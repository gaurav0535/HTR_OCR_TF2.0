a03-014-07.png,Boun Oum was considering asking
a03-014-08.png,Prince Souvanna Phouma to join his
a03-014-09.png,Government .
a03-017-00.png,Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to
a03-017-01.png,"the mission , but recent statements made by him"
a03-017-02.png,in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards
a03-017-03.png,himself as the only legal Prime Minister of
a03-017-04.png,Laos . His policy of strict neutrality from 1951
a03-017-05.png,"to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace , though"
a03-017-06.png,at the cost of virtual partition of the country
a03-017-07.png,into the pro-communist north and the
a03-017-08.png,pro-western centre and south .
a03-020-00.png,Prince Souvanna's former Minister of

a03-020-02.png,claims to be his representative in

a03-020-04.png,of the pro-communist forces
a03-020-05.png,occupying the province of Xieng
a03-020-06.png,Khouang and emphasized that

a03-020-09.png,"Haksat Party , also to the officers"
a03-020-10.png,in the same terms .
a03-023-00.png,This emphasis on the legality of the former
a03-023-01.png,Government suggests that all is not well
a03-023-02.png,with the political and military leadership
a03-023-03.png,of the pro-communists . Most of the
a03-023-04.png,province of Xieng Khouang and the
a03-023-05.png,"tactically useful Plain of Jars , however ,"
a03-023-06.png,appear still to be firmly in their hands .
a03-023-07.png,The Government has claimed the
a03-023-08.png,"recapture of Vang Vieng , the pro-"
a03-023-09.png,communists' former base 60 miles
a03-023-10.png,"north of Vientiane , but this claim"
a03-027-00.png,A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within
a03-027-01.png,a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by officers that

a03-027-06.png,Party are holding a national conference here with
a03-027-07.png,"some 2,000 delegates , the biggest gathering since 1958"
a03-027-08.png,when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party
a03-027-09.png,leader .
a03-030-00.png,In some ways it will be a testing occasion
a03-030-01.png,"for him , although some think his position"
a03-030-02.png,unassailable simply because there is no one
a03-030-03.png,else in sight to supplant him . So the con-
a03-030-04.png,ference will concentrate on laying the
a03-030-05.png,foundations on which to win the next
a03-030-06.png,election . The rally comes at a time
a03-030-07.png,when in spite of carefully worded state-
a03-030-08.png,ments by the Prime Minister there is an
a03-030-09.png,air of electoral expectancy .
a03-034-00.png,Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
a03-034-01.png,a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
a03-034-02.png,which outlines in some detail the accomplishments
a03-034-03.png,of the party since it came to office three and
a03-034-04.png,a half years ago . Nevertheless there is little
a03-034-05.png,illusion in the Conservative Party that their
a03-034-06.png,stock at home has fallen in the face of
a03-034-07.png,heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy .
a03-037-00.png,Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
a03-037-01.png,"provincial governments , Quebec and New Brunswick , and"
a03-037-02.png,in the four federal by-elections last October the party
a03-037-03.png,fared badly . They are now faced with four other by-
a03-037-04.png,"elections , one at Esquimalt Saanich , British Columbia ,"
a03-037-05.png,"one in Leeds , Ontario , and the other two in the"
a03-037-06.png,"Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska , New Brunswick ,"
a03-037-07.png,"and Kings , Prince Edward Island ."
a03-040-00.png,All four were Conservative strongholds . Last September
a03-040-01.png,a public poll showed that for the first time since
a03-040-02.png,the Administration came to power in 1957 the
a03-040-03.png,Liberals were ahead ( 43 per cent were in favour
a03-040-04.png,"of "" The Grits "" if a federal election had been"
a03-040-05.png,"held last autumn , 38 per cent for the"
a03-040-06.png,Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F. ) .
a03-043-00.png,"However , a separate poll revealed that Mr."
a03-043-01.png,Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
a03-043-02.png,popularity as an individual leader ( for
a03-043-03.png,"Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent , for Mr."
a03-043-04.png,Pearson 34 per cent ) . How far is Mr.
a03-043-05.png,Lester Pearson acceptable to the people
a03-043-06.png,of Canada as a Prime Minister ? Many
a03-043-07.png,observers at the national rally will be
a03-043-08.png,seeking an answer .
a03-047-00.png,It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
a03-047-01.png,in the role of a popular orator at the
a03-047-02.png,"hustings , the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-"
a03-047-03.png,baker was in the last two campaigns . The
a03-047-04.png,impression remains that the Liberal leader
a03-047-05.png,"is still the diplomatist , more at home"
a03-047-06.png,"in the chancery , or the corridors of the United"
a03-047-07.png,"Nations , not the father figure , so necessary"
a03-047-08.png,"in Canadian leadership , or the practical"
a03-047-09.png,"politician , able to talk about sewage problems"
a03-047-10.png,in Algoma East .
a03-050-00.png,"On the other hand , Mr. Pearson excels"
a03-050-01.png,"in meeting people informally , but many"
a03-050-02.png,"still regard him "" as some sort of cross"
a03-050-03.png,"between an egghead and a missionary "" ."
a03-050-04.png,His party advisers are now trying to
a03-050-05.png,correct that image . The bow tie has
a03-050-06.png,gone ; he is having lessons on
a03-050-07.png,television techniques and is being coached
a03-050-08.png,by speech experts .
a03-054-00.png,Everything is being done to promote
a03-054-01.png,"a new image . Certainly , he is now a"
a03-054-02.png,much lessly trounced by Mr. Diefen-
a03-054-03.png,baker in the House in those early

a04-047-01.png,"of General and Municipal Workers , he said he felt"
a04-047-02.png,sure the Labour movement was coming round in
a04-047-03.png,support of his views . Obviously conscious of the fierce and
a04-047-04.png,widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
a04-047-05.png,"Britain , Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that"
a04-047-06.png,supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
a04-047-07.png,their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
a04-047-08.png,to the missile .
a04-050-00.png,Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
a04-050-01.png,not deny facilities to nations to which it was
a04-050-02.png,allied . But governments should be free to negotiate
a04-050-03.png,and refuse proposals with which they did not
a04-050-04.png,"agree . The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles , because ,"
a04-050-05.png,"he said , they were out of date and vulnerable and"
a04-050-06.png,would attract enemy action .
a04-054-00.png,That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine .
a04-054-01.png,"So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons ,"
a04-054-02.png,"the West , somewhere , must have them too . It"
a04-054-03.png,was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
a04-054-04.png,purposes to be under the sea rather than on land .
a04-054-05.png,This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
a04-054-06.png,to oppose the Polaris depot ship .
a04-059-00.png,The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
a04-059-01.png,"in the Holy Loch , only 30 miles from Glasgow , a"
a04-059-02.png,city with two million people . It should be sited
a04-059-03.png,in a more remote area . Mr. Gaitskell added that
a04-059-04.png,"the Scarborough conference decisions did not , in his"
a04-059-05.png,"view , truly reflect the opinions of the majority"
a04-059-06.png,of party members and still less the party's
a04-059-07.png,supporters in the country .
a04-066-00.png,Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
a04-066-01.png,"unilateralists was not possible , though"
a04-066-02.png,he respected their views . He saw by reports
a04-066-03.png,"that "" those who organise these things "" were"
a04-066-04.png,recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear

a04-085-05.png,Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
a04-085-06.png,the views of a wide section of the

a04-085-08.png,bases in this country . An open letter

a04-092-00.png,There are three kinds of reasons that justify

a04-092-03.png,first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
a04-092-04.png,serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
a04-092-05.png,"U.S. and Great Britain , not only in Government"
a04-092-06.png,"circles , but in public opinion . "" Earl Russell"
a04-092-07.png,"says it is inevitable , though profoundly"
a04-092-08.png,"regrettable , that the agitation against"
a04-092-09.png,the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
a04-092-10.png,to the policy of the United States .
a04-096-00.png,The second reason is concerned with doubts
a04-096-01.png,as to the safety of the people of Great Britain ;
a04-096-02.png,""" in the time of crisis it would probably be"
a04-096-03.png,impossible for the British authorities to

a04-096-06.png,there is a distinct possibility that so long
a04-096-07.png,as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
a04-096-08.png,Soviet Union might retaliate against

a04-103-00.png,The third reason is that the supreme

a05-013-07.png,Serviceman out of uniform by the end
a05-013-08.png,of 1962 .
a05-017-00.png,The Minister regards the recent trend
a05-017-01.png,of recruiting figures as encouraging .
a05-017-02.png,He is confident the aim can be achieved .
a05-017-03.png,While the possibility of an eventual return
a05-017-04.png,to National Service in some form
a05-017-05.png,"cannot be entirely discounted , he does"
a05-017-06.png,not agree that the point has been reached
a05-017-07.png,where this need even be considered . If
a05-017-08.png,"National Service is ever resorted to ,"
a05-017-09.png,engagement would probably have to be for
a05-017-10.png,three years .
a05-022-00.png,It is thought this would be the minimum
a05-022-01.png,necessary for the extended training modern
a05-022-02.png,arms require and to enable each man to
a05-022-03.png,serve at least a year overseas . There is
a05-022-04.png,no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
a05-022-05.png,is at odds with the Service chiefs over
a05-022-06.png,the decision to dispense with National
a05-022-07.png,"Service , or over any other aspect of"
a05-022-08.png,defence policy .
a05-025-00.png,Criticisms about Army manpower appear
a05-025-01.png,to have come mainly from retired officers
a05-025-02.png,who have held high positions but
a05-025-03.png,are out of touch with the existing situation .
a05-025-04.png,Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
a05-025-05.png,"from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir"
a05-025-06.png,"Francis Festing , who believes completely"
a05-025-07.png,in the principle of an all-Regular army .
a05-025-08.png,"Gen. Sir Richard Hull , who is to succeed"
a05-025-09.png,"Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr."
a05-025-10.png,Watkinson is right .
a05-029-00.png,Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard
a05-029-01.png,"as from Nov. 1 . The hand-over , due in"
a05-029-02.png,"September , was delayed because of the"
a05-029-03.png,Berlin crisis . Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
a05-029-04.png,felt the change would be unwise at a
a05-029-05.png,moment # when attention had to be
a05-029-06.png,concentrated on possible need for important
a05-029-07.png,military operations . For this reason Sir
a05-029-08.png,"Francis stayed on , and # sacrificed"
a05-029-09.png,his leave .
a05-039-00.png,There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing
a05-039-01.png,"towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd ,"
a05-039-02.png,the Prime Minister . This implies the dis-
a05-039-03.png,appearance of the Progressive party from
a05-039-04.png,the House . Early results in yesterday's
a05-039-05.png,general election showed Nationalists being
a05-039-06.png,"returned in their strongholds , like Bloem-"
a05-039-07.png,"fontein and the Transvaal , with slightly"
a05-039-08.png,"increased majorities . In the Cape , the"
a05-039-09.png,"veteran United Party politician , Mr. Harry"
a05-039-10.png,"Lawrence , standing as a Progressive , was"
a05-044-00.png,The defeat of the leader of the
a05-044-01.png,"Progressive party , Dr. Steytler , in Port"
a05-044-02.png,"Elizabeth South , announced immediately"
a05-044-03.png,"afterwards by the United party candidate ,"
a05-044-04.png,"Mr. Plewman , left the Progressives deprived"
a05-044-05.png,of both their chief figures . Dr. Verwoerd and
a05-044-06.png,"the Leader of the Opposition , Sir de"
a05-044-07.png,"Villiers Graaff , have been returned unopposed ."
a05-044-08.png,The contests were for 86 seats as 70
a05-044-09.png,Nationalists and 20 United party candi-
a05-044-10.png,dates are unopposed .
a05-048-00.png,Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was
a05-048-01.png,evident that voters were bored by the
a05-048-02.png,Government's frequent appeals to the electorate .
a05-048-03.png,The election was the fourth in four years .
a05-048-04.png,In most constituencies it may go down as
a05-048-05.png,the most apathetic in the country's history .
a05-048-06.png,THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
a05-048-07.png,last night that he had considered early
a05-048-08.png,in the Parliamentary recess whether to
a05-048-09.png,mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
a05-048-10.png,British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing .
a05-053-00.png,He decided that it would be a great error
a05-053-01.png,to do so and to recall Parliament . But
a05-053-02.png,there would be no hesitation in mobilising
a05-053-03.png,if a further deterioration in the situation
a05-053-04.png,warranted such a step . It would have to be
a05-053-05.png,"accompanied by other measures of a military ,"
a05-053-06.png,"economic and political kind . Mr. Macmillan ,"
a05-053-07.png,who was winding up the foreign affairs
a05-053-08.png,"debate , said the Government could not"
a05-053-09.png,be party to accepting as a matter of
a05-053-10.png,principle the imposed division of Germany .
a05-058-00.png,""" We must not be rattled into surrender ,"
a05-058-01.png,but we must not - and I am not - be
a05-058-02.png,"afraid of negotiation . "" Mr. Godber ,"
a05-058-03.png,"Minister of State , Foreign Office , said"
a05-058-04.png,earlier that the Government had asked
a05-058-05.png,the Medical Research Council to reassess
a05-058-06.png,the fall-out position in view of the Russian
a05-058-07.png,tests . The Council's findings would be
a05-058-08.png,made public .
a05-062-00.png,With a vigour and authority which delighted
a05-062-01.png,"old Parliamentary friends and foes alike ,"
a05-062-02.png,"the Earl of Avon , the former Sir Anthony"
a05-062-03.png,"Eden , in his maiden speech in the House"
a05-062-04.png,"of Lords last night , gave a warning"
a05-062-05.png,that # appeasement over Berlin could
a05-062-06.png,"only lead to war . To stand firm , he"
a05-062-07.png,"declared , was not to invite war , but"
a05-062-08.png,the surest way to avert it .
a05-069-00.png,It was the end of a rather curious
a05-069-01.png,speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
a05-069-02.png,the two-day debate on foreign affairs .
a05-069-03.png,"He began in a low , almost chatty mono-"
a05-069-04.png,"tone , and his voice never rose to any"
a05-069-05.png,accent of urgency . He passed in rapid
a05-069-06.png,review the United Nations Secretariat ;
a05-069-07.png,nuclear tests ; the canard about British
a05-069-08.png,interference with the United Nations
a05-069-09.png,in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East
a05-069-10.png,Asia .
a05-073-00.png,He spent most of his short half-hour on
a05-073-01.png,Berlin . He deplored the possibility of
a05-073-02.png,"some "" new myth "" about betrayal of Germany"
a05-073-03.png,"by the Allies . "" We do not , "" he said , "" really"
a05-073-04.png,"know what the Russians want . "" But he was"
a05-073-05.png,certain that they wanted to establish a
a05-073-06.png,final and irrevocable division of Germany .
a05-073-07.png,Britain could not be a party to an imposed
a05-073-08.png,"division . But negotiation , as the debate had"
a05-073-09.png,"shown , could be undertaken on a variety"
a05-073-10.png,of bases .
a05-080-00.png,Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
a05-080-01.png,ately refrained during the summer from
a05-080-02.png,recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
a05-080-03.png,"by proclamation , such as would be"
a05-080-04.png,necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
a05-080-05.png,on to a fully active footing . That
a05-080-06.png,would have created a thoroughly unde-
a05-080-07.png,sirable atmosphere of panic . He thought
a05-080-08.png,that the situation was rather more
a05-080-09.png,hopeful .
a05-084-00.png,The Russians now realised its seriousness . The
a05-084-01.png,French doubts were more about procedure
a05-084-02.png,than about substance . The Prime Minister's
a05-084-03.png,attitude of studied calm brought down the
a05-084-04.png,"temperature of the debate , which never"
a05-084-05.png,"at any time rose to fever pitch , to a"
a05-084-06.png,remarkable degree of sub-normality .
a05-084-07.png,Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
a05-084-08.png,"of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening"
a05-084-09.png,in the Peers' Gallery .
a05-089-00.png,The early speakers in the debate each
a05-089-01.png,severely rated the speech of his predecessor .
a05-089-02.png,These strictures were all too well justified .
a05-089-03.png,We started with the plaintive wailings
a05-089-04.png,"of Mr. Healey , "" Shadow "" Foreign Secretary ,"
a05-089-05.png,"described by Mr. Godber , Minister of"
a05-089-06.png,"State , Foreign Office , as "" pedantic and"
a05-089-07.png,"obscure on Berlin , damaging and obscure"
a05-089-08.png,"on the Congo . "" In turn , Mr. Godber was"
a05-089-09.png,"censured by Mr. Shinwell , former Labour"
a05-089-10.png,"Defence Minister , for having read the"
a05-094-00.png,The trouble about such debates is that
a05-094-01.png,they range too widely . They remind one of
a05-094-02.png,"the Rugby match in "" Tom Brown's Schooldays , """
a05-094-03.png,in which all the boys were welcome to
a05-094-04.png,"take part , and only those who "" really meant"
a05-094-05.png,"business "" removed their jackets . Not many"
a05-094-06.png,metaphorical braces were visible in the
a05-094-07.png,early stages of to-night's debate . Mr.
a05-094-08.png,Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
a05-094-09.png,"golf-course Press conference , which he"
a05-094-10.png,"described as "" a display of flabby and"
a05-099-00.png,A reference to the reunification of Germany
a05-099-01.png,"brought a bark of "" Start another war ! """
a05-099-02.png,"from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab. , Stoke on Trent S. ) ."
a05-099-03.png,Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
a05-099-04.png,theme of limitation of armaments in Europe .
a05-099-05.png,"This could , he suggested , be linked with"
a05-099-06.png,prohibition of the production of atomic
a05-099-07.png,weapons in any part of Europe . Inspection
a05-099-08.png,and control would be much easier to
a05-099-09.png,establish in these territories .
a05-104-00.png,Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
a05-104-01.png,using double standards . Ministers had
a05-104-02.png,rebuked the unaligned nations for not
a05-104-03.png,"condemning the new Russian tests , but"
a05-104-04.png,they themselves had no condemnation for
a05-104-05.png,events in Angola or Algeria . It was not for
a05-104-06.png,"the Government , said Mr. Healey , to"
a05-104-07.png,"take up moral attitudes , "" especially when"
a05-104-08.png,the temple of their religion is the
a05-104-09.png,"bingo-parlour . """
a05-108-00.png,This puzzled such students of comparative
a05-108-01.png,religion as had failed to detect this cult .
a05-108-02.png,But Mr. Healey had a partial and
a05-108-03.png,limited success . He rallied behind him
a05-108-04.png,the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last
a05-108-05.png,"night by his leader , Mr. Gaitskell . Mr."
a05-108-06.png,Godber's performance merited all the mild
a05-108-07.png,scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell .
a05-113-00.png,"True , he did tell the House that the"
a05-113-01.png,Government had asked the Medical Research
a05-113-02.png,Council to reassess the fall-out position in
a05-113-03.png,"view of the Russian tests , and said that"
a05-113-04.png,the council's findings would be published .
a05-113-05.png,He was not so happy in his defence of
a05-113-06.png,the Government's failure to condemn
a05-113-07.png,France for her nuclear tests in the
a05-113-08.png,Sahara on the grounds that they were
a05-113-09.png,only little ones .
a05-116-00.png,This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid
a05-116-01.png,and her illegitimate baby . For the most
a05-116-02.png,"part , Mr. Godber muttered his way"
a05-116-03.png,through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office
a05-116-04.png,"brief . He resembles the elephant seal , an"
a05-116-05.png,# otherwise endearing creature whose

a06-000-04.png,dramatically in the Commons yesterday . Mr

a06-004-00.png,"Sir Edward Boyle , Financial Secretary"
a06-004-01.png,"to the Treasury , said yesterday that the"
a06-004-02.png,Government does not like retrospective legislation .
a06-004-03.png,He went on to describe the kind of
a06-004-04.png,people the Chancellor hopes to tax . These
a06-004-05.png,are people buying and selling shares within

b01-000-02.png,Government's policy of apartheid as we wait
b01-000-03.png,for the curtain to rise on the Commonwealth
b01-000-04.png,Conference in London . Will it end with
b01-000-05.png,South Africa's exclusion from the
b01-000-06.png,Commonwealth ? The issue is touch and go .
b01-004-00.png,There is a possibility that it will not be
b01-004-01.png,settled at this conference . It may be agreed to
b01-004-02.png,wait until South Africa actually becomes a
b01-004-03.png,Republic later in the year . But if a final
b01-004-04.png,"decision is to be faced now , on which side"
b01-004-05.png,do the strongest arguments lie ? THE Archbishop
b01-004-06.png,of Capetown has shown that the matter is
b01-004-07.png,not clear-cut .
b01-009-00.png,The Archbishop has long been a courageous
b01-009-01.png,fighter against apartheid . He must be heard
b01-009-02.png,with attention . On purely practical grounds he
b01-009-03.png,holds that it would be a mistake to expel
b01-009-04.png,"South Africa , weakening the whites who are"
b01-009-05.png,working for a change of policy . In his view
b01-009-06.png,it would also be against the interests of the
b01-009-07.png,Africans .
b01-014-00.png,He holds that more pressure can be put on South
b01-014-01.png,Africa while she remains in the Commonwealth
b01-014-02.png,than could be exercised were she cut off from it .
b01-014-03.png,"On the other hand , those who favour expulsion , inclu-"
b01-014-04.png,"ding African leaders , feel that nothing less than the"
b01-014-05.png,shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr.
b01-014-06.png,Verwoerd and the Nationalists . They point out
b01-014-07.png,that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning
b01-014-08.png,the apartheid policy .
b01-018-00.png,THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society . A
b01-018-01.png,policy of racial discrimination in any of its countries
b01-018-02.png,is surely the one thing that it could not survive .
b01-018-03.png,Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in
b01-018-04.png,"London , millions at home would regard as fraudulent"
b01-018-05.png,a Commonwealth which had room for a racist
b01-018-06.png,South Africa . And this is a Commonwealth in
b01-018-07.png,which five citizens are coloured for every one
b01-018-08.png,who is white .
b01-023-00.png,"Seen in this wider picture , a South Africa that clings to"
b01-023-01.png,apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a
b01-023-02.png,liability to the whole Western world . A practical
b01-023-03.png,solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft
b01-023-04.png,a set of principles excluding race discrimination .
b01-023-05.png,"And so leave South Africa to make the grade ,"
b01-023-06.png,or go out .
b01-027-00.png,THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home
b01-027-01.png,tonight from their tour in the East . The duke's
b01-027-02.png,trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts
b01-027-03.png,have taken the headlines in this country .
b01-027-04.png,"Nevertheless , the tour has been an immense"
b01-027-05.png,success . The Queen has won a triumph . It
b01-027-06.png,would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal
b01-027-07.png,performances as tiger and rhino hunts were
b01-027-08.png,dropped from future Royal programmes .
b01-033-00.png,But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by
b01-033-01.png,their visit . The warmth of their welcome in India and
b01-033-02.png,Pakistan are happy memories . WEST GERMANY - followed
b01-033-03.png,yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture
b01-033-04.png,of a good neighbour . She has put up the value
b01-033-05.png,of her money .
b01-038-00.png,"Certainly , the rise is very small . But it is a step"
b01-038-01.png,in the direction of live-and-let-live . Hopes
b01-038-02.png,will now grow brighter of further international
b01-038-03.png,"co-operation , which is the only way to solve the"
b01-038-04.png,payments difficulties that upset the Western world .
b01-038-05.png,"Britain and the U.S. , which have problems with"
b01-038-06.png,"their balances , will gain some immediate help ."
b01-038-07.png,What it means in practical terms is that our
b01-038-08.png,exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
b01-038-09.png,"for Germans to buy , while the goods which"
b01-038-10.png,Germany exports will be made a little dearer .
b01-044-00.png,Booming Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports
b01-044-01.png,as a means to curb rising prices at home . She is
b01-044-02.png,also aware how # unpopular she has been growing
b01-044-03.png,by failing until now to co-operate as a creditor nation
b01-044-04.png,should . Germany exports much more than she imports .
b01-044-05.png,For upwards of five years the world's reserves of
b01-044-06.png,dollars have been drained into Germany .
b01-049-00.png,There they have stayed uselessly locked up because
b01-049-01.png,Germany has no tradition of trading abroad . In addition
b01-049-02.png,the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted
b01-049-03.png,"speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars ,"
b01-049-04.png,"hoping for the mark to rise , as has now happened ."
b01-049-05.png,WILL the new valuation be enough to correct
b01-049-06.png,Germany's massive trading surplus and choke
b01-049-07.png,off speculation against dollar and pound ?
b01-053-00.png,"That is doubtful . If however , in addition to her new"
b01-053-01.png,"good-neighbour gesture , Germany takes a really big"
b01-053-02.png,"share in giving aid to underdeveloped nations , the"
b01-053-03.png,world outlook will be brighter . What gives rise
b01-053-04.png,to optimism is the sign that Germany and the
b01-053-05.png,other leading Western nations are at long last
b01-053-06.png,moving towards a solution of currency problems
b01-053-07.png,by co-operation .
b01-057-00.png,"A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine , paid"
b01-057-01.png,for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament .
b01-057-02.png,Those who lend their names to this kind of
b01-057-03.png,"advertisement are worthy people , a little innocent"
b01-057-04.png,"of politics , perhaps , or carried away by the"
b01-057-05.png,idea that moral regeneration would solve

b01-057-08.png,would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in
b01-057-09.png,"instruments of democracy , such as trade unions"
b01-057-10.png,and our local and national Parliaments .
b01-062-00.png,Should the Herald publish such advertisements ?
b01-062-01.png,This is a difficult question . It would obviously
b01-062-02.png,be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
b01-062-03.png,which we disagree . When an advertisement
b01-062-04.png,contains statements whose factual truth is
b01-062-05.png,"doubtful , or where the total content would be"
b01-062-06.png,"deeply repugnant to our readers , it is right to"
b01-062-07.png,exercise editorial discretion . The MRA
b01-062-08.png,"advertisement falls into neither category , though"
b01-062-09.png,many readers will dislike it .
b01-073-00.png,The first reaction of the Sudanese
b01-073-01.png,Government was to denounce the United
b01-073-02.png,"Nations for "" negligence and impotence , "" and"
b01-073-03.png,to say that its 400 troops in the Congo
b01-073-04.png,would be taken home . The reaction can be
b01-073-05.png,understood . The Sudan's concern for its
b01-073-06.png,men is natural . But this could hardly be
b01-073-07.png,a # dignified exit . IF the UN is
b01-073-08.png,"blamed for being weak , it would be"
b01-073-09.png,"more logical to send in more men ,"
b01-073-10.png,not weaken it further by desertion .
b01-079-00.png,It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
b01-079-01.png,Hammarskjold and the UN's servants . The
b01-079-02.png,responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
b01-079-03.png,which have undertaken the task of pre-
b01-079-04.png,serving peace in the Congo . That is not a
b01-079-05.png,"ceremonial duty , and the soldiers have every"
b01-079-06.png,right to blame the politicians unless they see
b01-079-07.png,it through . When the United Nations instructed
b01-079-08.png,Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
b01-079-09.png,"prevent civil war , it was clear that new dangers"
b01-079-10.png,would arise unless it gave him the political ...
b01-084-00.png,That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold
b01-084-01.png,made . India has responded handsomely by providing
b01-084-02.png,"3,000 men , who must take about a fortnight to arrive ."
b01-084-03.png,"If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground ,"
b01-084-04.png,such incidents as that at Matadi would not
b01-084-05.png,happen . THE UN's ability to keep peace depends
b01-084-06.png,simply on adequate support by the nations
b01-084-07.png,which have set their hands to this plough .
b01-089-00.png,The big Powers involved in the Cold War
b01-089-01.png,must of course keep out . The Americans were
b01-089-02.png,justified in diverting naval ships in case
b01-089-03.png,non-combatant help was wanted ; but they
b01-089-04.png,stressed that there was no intention to intervene
b01-089-05.png,in fighting . Yesterday the ships turned away
b01-089-06.png,"again , satisfied that they were not required ."
b01-089-07.png,It is to be hoped that the UN will be
b01-089-08.png,re-established in their port by negotiation
b01-089-09.png,and that there will be no more outrages .
b01-094-00.png,"But back , Mr. Hammarskjold is determined ,"
b01-094-01.png,they must go . The best news for the Congo
b01-094-02.png,would be agreement between its rival
b01-094-03.png,political leaders . Through the patient efforts
b01-094-04.png,of UN conciliators they are meeting for
b01-094-05.png,"the first time , in Malagasy ( formerly"
b01-094-06.png,Madagascar ) . THE world will sigh with
b01-094-07.png,relief when this strife-torn land gets
b01-094-08.png,itself a government which all outsiders
b01-094-09.png,can recognise .
b01-113-00.png,ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards
b01-113-01.png,"as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as "" a"
b01-113-02.png,"policy of good neighbourliness . "" We may be sure that"
b01-113-03.png,he is not being hypocritical . That is what he
b01-113-04.png,really believes . A good neighbour to those Africans
b01-113-05.png,"who , under apartheid , will be forced back to"
b01-113-06.png,their tribal reserves with no prospect but a
b01-113-07.png,cramped and primitive existence .
b01-118-00.png,A good neighbour to those Africans who will con-
b01-118-01.png,tinue to live as hewers of wood and drawers of
b01-118-02.png,"water in the white areas of South Africa , without rights"
b01-118-03.png,and without hope . THE same sort of good neighbour
b01-118-04.png,that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
b01-118-05.png,Hitler in the thirties . It was Dr. Verwoerd who
b01-118-06.png,led a protest against admitting any of them
b01-118-07.png,"because they would "" defile "" the national"
b01-118-08.png,white stock .
b01-122-00.png,It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
b01-122-01.png,woerd in his nightmare world . It is this that
b01-122-02.png,makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
b01-122-03.png,fluenced to change course . The Archbishop of
b01-122-04.png,"Capetown , Dr. Joost de Blank , has pleaded that"
b01-122-05.png,South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
b01-122-06.png,"Commonwealth . Otherwise , he says , those inside the"
b01-122-07.png,country who still oppose apartheid will be
b01-122-08.png,left even more isolated and alone .
b01-127-00.png,"The views of the Archbishop , who has"
b01-127-01.png,maintained an unflinching witness to what
b01-127-02.png,"Christianity really means , must carry weight . But"
b01-127-03.png,"what , in fact , can the other Commonwealth countries"
b01-127-04.png,do to bring support and comfort to this gallant
b01-127-05.png,minority ? THERE is no evidence that the
b01-127-06.png,policy of appeasement has modified the
b01-127-07.png,"actions of the Nationalists . On the contrary ,"
b01-127-08.png,apartheid is being applied ever more
b01-127-09.png,ruthlessly .
b01-132-00.png,The shock of expulsion from the
b01-132-01.png,Commonwealth now seems to be the only
b01-132-02.png,way left to try to bring home to the people of
b01-132-03.png,South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them
b01-132-04.png,to disaster . It may be that the Commonwealth
b01-132-05.png,Prime Ministers will decide against this final
b01-132-06.png,step . If that is their decision they should also
b01-132-07.png,go unequivocally on record that they regard
b01-132-08.png,apartheid as evil and indefensible .
b01-136-00.png,"Unless they do at least that , Dr. Verwoerd will"
b01-136-01.png,be able to return home claiming a triumph .
b01-136-02.png,His smile will be blander than ever . WE are in
b01-136-03.png,for it again : another Royal Wedding . Between
b01-136-04.png,"now and June , when the Duke of Kent will"
b01-136-05.png,"marry Miss Worsley , hardly a day will pass"
b01-136-06.png,"without a story or a picture or probably both ,"
b01-136-07.png,about the nuptial arrangements .
b02-013-00.png,What seems certain is that those who
b02-013-01.png,advocate putting off any approach until
b02-013-02.png,Mr Krushchev gives evidence of a change
b02-013-03.png,of heart ( whatever that may mean ) would
b02-013-04.png,have us run risks greater than the West
b02-013-05.png,ought to run - and greater than President
b02-013-06.png,Kennedy's most influential advisers seem
b02-013-07.png,disposed to face . The real question is
b02-013-08.png,what we should put to the Soviet
b02-013-09.png,Government as a basis for talks : and
b02-035-00.png,On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls
b02-035-01.png,"manoeuvring , and what we should call"
b02-035-02.png,"cool-headed and inventive negotiation , is"
b02-035-03.png,a means not to destruction but to safety .
b02-035-04.png,The Government's pompous little statement
b02-035-05.png,"on Northern Rhodesia does not say much ,"
b02-035-06.png,but it says what is necessary - that
b02-035-07.png,the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
b02-035-08.png,"open to revision . This is news , however"
b02-035-09.png,much the Government tries to disguise
b02-035-10.png,it by saying that the revision would be
b02-045-00.png,"Formula One , which appeared in February , appeared to make"
b02-045-01.png,"this likely ; Formula Two , which appeared in June , made it"
b02-045-02.png,very unlikely ; if Formula Three restores the original
b02-045-03.png,"principle , that is all that need be required of it . It is a pity"
b02-045-04.png,that the Government should ever have been led away
b02-045-05.png,from this principle . It is a great pity that the
b02-045-06.png,"Government should give the appearance of responding , not"
b02-045-07.png,"to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations , but to"
b02-045-08.png,the violence which he tried to prevent .
b02-097-00.png,"To be able to say "" New York next week "" is an"
b02-097-01.png,important advance . We must not be overconfident
b02-097-02.png,that this # meeting will lead on to further
b02-097-03.png,"and decisive ones ; but without it , we could not"
b02-097-04.png,look for them . Federal Germany votes tomorrow
b02-097-05.png,and not a day too soon . There can seldom have
b02-097-06.png,been an election campaign which more people
b02-097-07.png,in and out of the country wanted to see over
b02-097-08.png,and done with .
b02-102-00.png,To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a
b02-102-01.png,millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their
b02-102-02.png,efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with
b02-102-03.png,the Berlin crisis . It need not have been such a burden
b02-102-04.png,if Western Governments had not been convinced
b02-102-05.png,that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr
b02-102-06.png,Adenauer's chances of being returned as Chancellor .
b02-105-00.png,But they were so convinced and they
b02-105-01.png,have had to take the consequences . Mean-
b02-105-02.png,while in Germany itself the course of
b02-105-03.png,the campaign has dismayed a good
b02-105-04.png,many people : they too will be glad
b02-105-05.png,when the polling stations close .
b03-025-00.png,But discussion on current points of east-west con-
b03-025-01.png,"flict could not go much farther than , for example , the"
b03-025-02.png,truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
b03-025-03.png,cannot be followed together . What the council has done -
b03-025-04.png,and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-
b03-025-05.png,tact across the greatest political barrier in what
b03-025-06.png,is not yet a unitary world .
b03-087-00.png,The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
b03-087-01.png,agreement is signed . To this there will be some opposition . The Bill is
b03-087-02.png,"short and modest in scope , and it is doubtful whether the other Private"
b03-087-03.png,Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps . This fact may give
b03-087-04.png,the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the
b03-087-05.png,next report from the Molony committee .
b03-092-00.png,"Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable . They should not ,"
b03-092-01.png,"however , disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of"
b03-092-02.png,parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run .
b03-092-03.png,Centigrade v. Fahrenheit . The fight is on . The challenger has behind
b03-092-04.png,it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR
b03-092-05.png,but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro-
b03-092-06.png,logical Office .
b03-098-00.png,The press and the broadcasting authorities are
b03-098-01.png,"asked to help . To begin with , both tempe-"
b03-098-02.png,ratures will be put in the ring together .
b03-098-03.png,"SIR GRAHAM SUTTON , however , made no bones"
b03-098-04.png,about it yesterday . The purpose is to give
b03-098-05.png,fahrenheit the knock out . The backers of
b03-098-06.png,centigrade would have got off to a better
b03-098-07.png,start if they had taken more pains to
b03-098-08.png,explain the advantages to the general
b03-098-09.png,public of the change .
b03-104-00.png,It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is
b03-104-01.png,"at the moment "" an awful mess up "" in"
b03-104-02.png,"the measurement of temperatures . This ,"
b03-104-03.png,"however , seems a matter of the convenience"
b03-104-04.png,of specialists . The ordinary British man
b03-104-05.png,and woman is conscious of no difficulty .
b03-104-06.png,Rather than fifty million people having
b03-104-07.png,"to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there"
b03-104-08.png,any reason why the centigrade countries
b03-104-09.png,should not change to fahrenheit ?
b03-109-00.png,Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-
b03-109-01.png,strably better than the other ? The centigraders may
b03-109-02.png,be in for a stiffer fight than they think . They may
b03-109-03.png,have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market .
b03-109-04.png,Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
b03-109-05.png,public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
b03-109-06.png,circumstances the time would come when this would
b03-109-07.png,suit their convenience - rather than to change their
b03-109-08.png,system of recording temperatures .
b03-114-00.png,"In any case , fahrenheit need not lose heart ."
b03-114-01.png,"Once before , and that not so long ago , the"
b03-114-02.png,authorities ganged up to alter the habits
b03-114-03.png,of the people . That effort was to enforce
b03-114-04.png,the adoption of the twenty-four hour
b03-114-05.png,"clock . Then , also , the B.B.C. were"
b03-114-06.png,roped in . The only result was
b03-114-07.png,that the well-meaning corporation
b03-114-08.png,became very unpopular .
b04-000-00.png,A BAFFLED and bewildered little country
b04-000-01.png,stands at the centre of an international
b04-000-02.png,storm . Belgium is accused - without a
b04-000-03.png,scrap of evidence - of being implicated in
b04-000-04.png,the murder of Patrice Lumumba . Her
b04-000-05.png,"leaders are insulted , her embassies are"
b04-000-06.png,attacked in a score of countries .
b04-004-00.png,"In Ghana , President Nkrumah , who"
b04-004-01.png,has done more than most to stir up
b04-004-02.png,"trouble in the Congo , orders every Belgian"
b04-004-03.png,citizen to quit his country . HOUNDING
b04-004-04.png,Belgium has become an international
b04-004-05.png,pastime . Why ? Because those who
b04-004-06.png,said the Congolese could govern themselves
b04-004-07.png,will not admit they were wrong . So
b04-004-08.png,"Belgium , bowed down by internal"
b04-004-09.png,"troubles , mourning a terrible air crash ,"
b04-004-10.png,is made their scapegoat .
b04-010-00.png,Who will speak for Belgium ? Who else but
b04-010-01.png,Britain . We have fought beside Belgium
b04-010-02.png,in two world wars . We are allies still .
b04-010-03.png,Britain should champion Belgium . Not
b04-010-04.png,"with the careful , hooded language of diplomacy ,"
b04-010-05.png,but boldly and fearlessly . It is time to
b04-010-06.png,show the world that this country does not
b04-010-07.png,"desert her friends . HAPPY , happy"
b04-010-08.png,families ! Never before have Britain's
b04-010-09.png,larders been so well stocked .
b04-020-00.png,Supplies of meat and dairy produce were
b04-020-01.png,substantially higher last year than in 1959 .
b04-020-02.png,"Lucky , lucky housewives ! To have such a"
b04-020-03.png,splendid variety of goods to choose from .
b04-020-04.png,Not so long ago older folk were reminding
b04-020-05.png,"young wives , # harassed by"
b04-020-06.png,"shortages , of the good old days of"
b04-020-07.png,abundance . Now it is mother who
b04-020-08.png,picks up recipes from # her daughter .
b04-026-00.png,The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in
b04-026-01.png,"Britain today ! "" THIS is colour day , "" proclaimed the American"
b04-026-02.png,"television network , N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its"
b04-026-03.png,programmes in bright colours . In America colour TV is five years
b04-026-04.png,"old . There are already 600,000 sets in use . What about Britain ?"
b04-026-05.png,"The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service , but the"
b04-026-06.png,commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years .
b04-034-00.png,The Government should settle this argument with two words to
b04-034-01.png,the B.B.C. : - Go ahead ! ONE man beyond all others is saddened
b04-034-02.png,by the deaths of two elderly sisters who killed themselves because
b04-034-03.png,"they had to leave their cottage . Mr. John Crabb , clerk to"
b04-034-04.png,"Newmarket urban council , says : "" I shall always feel this as a"
b04-034-05.png,"personal failure . """
b04-040-00.png,There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself . The
b04-040-01.png,sisters had to quit as their home was falling down . And Mr. Crabb
b04-040-02.png,"did his best for them , even driving them to a new house . John"
b04-040-03.png,Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding . Too
b04-040-04.png,often lacking in officialdom . MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton
b04-040-05.png,does not want his daughter to marry a Scotsman .
b04-047-00.png,He says that the Scots are foreigners who have no business to
b04-047-01.png,be in England . The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a
b04-047-02.png,Scot . The Lord Chancellor is a Scot . The Prime Minister is a
b04-047-03.png,Scot - and so were four of his predecessors this # century .
b04-047-04.png,Let Mr. Newton beware . By protesting against Scotland he
b04-047-05.png,may be guilty of rebellion !
b04-054-00.png,ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial .
b04-054-01.png,His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for
b04-054-02.png,five years . During this period Britain will be expected
b04-054-03.png,to subsidise and defend the Cypriots . They will enjoy
b04-054-04.png,all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference . It is a
b04-054-05.png,safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
b04-054-06.png,company will sign on again .
b04-060-00.png,It is equally certain that the British Government
b04-060-01.png,"will welcome them . How splendid it would be if , just"
b04-060-02.png,"for once , the Government were to voice the real feelings of"
b04-060-03.png,the British people . And tell Makarios they are not
b04-060-04.png,prepared to accept him on such terms . GOOD cheer
b04-060-05.png,"for the week-end . Ford Motors are to put 13,000"
b04-060-06.png,men back on a five-day week .
b04-066-00.png,One more demonstration of the industry's recovery . As
b04-066-01.png,"springtime approaches , orders pick up . And the car men get"
b04-066-02.png,ready for another bustling season . The pessimists
b04-066-03.png,said the motor industry was on its knees . The optimists
b04-066-04.png,"said "" Nonsense . "" As usual , the optimists have been"
b04-066-05.png,proved right . EARL RUSSELL and his friends have
b04-066-06.png,hit on an original way of spending this afternoon .
b04-075-00.png,They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence . It is
b04-075-01.png,their protest against the H-bomb . They ought to have a
b04-075-02.png,"pleasant time . The weather forecast is good ; except for them ,"
b04-075-03.png,Whitehall should be deserted . And they will have a fine view
b04-075-04.png,"of St. James's Park , with its placid lake , pelicans ,"
b04-075-05.png,"rare ducks , and other wild life ."
b04-081-00.png,Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today ?
b04-081-01.png,Head for the parks to enjoy the sun . Not in
b04-081-02.png,"a foolish cause , but in a glorious one . Good health !"
b04-081-03.png,"THIS group of men , says a report , work on average"
b04-081-04.png,between 55 and 60 hours a week . They also put
b04-081-05.png,in an extra two or three evenings . And they never
b04-081-06.png,go on strike .
b04-089-00.png,Who are they ? The trade union officials of Britain .
b04-089-01.png,Men who earn only a fraction of what their
b04-089-02.png,talents and responsibilities could bring in the open
b04-089-03.png,labour market . The unions are fortunate indeed to
b04-089-04.png,find dedicated leaders at cut-rate prices . But it is
b04-089-05.png,time the members decided to pay up and be good
b04-089-06.png,employers . THE Labour Party says that the Tory
b04-089-07.png,Government is destroying the social services .
b04-096-00.png,Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
b04-096-01.png,national income was spent on social services . The
b04-096-02.png,present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
b04-096-03.png,worthwhile targets for the Opposition . What a pity
b04-096-04.png,"to aim at the wrong one ! MRS. MARCIA POWER ,"
b04-096-05.png,"whose husband made her clean his uniform , wins"
b04-096-06.png,a divorce . The judge says she had to act almost
b04-096-07.png,as a serf .
b04-103-00.png,Up and down the country husbands will be saying
b04-103-01.png,they would never behave like that . But do they ever
b04-103-02.png,ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously
b04-103-03.png,"returned to the shed ; their books tidied ; and often ,"
b04-103-04.png,even their shoes cleaned ? How wonderful if they
b04-103-05.png,showed their appreciation this morning with a surprise
b04-103-06.png,box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers !
b04-107-00.png,HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly
b04-107-01.png,in Rhodesia ! Eighteen months ago this territory
b04-107-02.png,"was peaceful , orderly , and thriving . Africans within the"
b04-107-03.png,Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
b04-107-04.png,administration . Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
b04-107-05.png,Secretary . Suddenly everything changed . Timetables were
b04-107-06.png,scrapped . The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
b04-107-07.png,"rushed out to Rhodesia . Overnight , minor African"
b04-107-08.png,politicians were inflated into international figures .
b04-116-00.png,And as the British Government stepped up the pace
b04-116-01.png,"of change , so the Africans stepped up their demands ."
b04-116-02.png,"TODAY , in London , that rash and thoughtless policy has"
b04-116-03.png,caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened .
b04-116-04.png,No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching .
b04-116-05.png,If the Government now reverses its plan to give the
b04-116-06.png,Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face
b04-116-07.png,difficulties from African politicians greedy for power .
b04-121-00.png,But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
b04-121-01.png,"be plunged into chaos , like the Congo . For Mr."
b04-121-02.png,Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice . They
b04-121-03.png,must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos . And try to
b04-121-04.png,repair the damage they have done . WHO can grow the
b04-121-05.png,fastest ? That is the exciting competition going on
b04-121-06.png,among Britain's major industries .
b04-128-00.png,"Top of the table , at the moment , is the chemical industry ."
b04-128-01.png,"Then comes engineering , followed by iron and steel ."
b04-128-02.png,Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
b04-128-03.png,tremendous upsurge in investment . It reports that new
b04-128-04.png,factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
b04-128-05.png,up on 1960 . Britain's business men are right to back
b04-128-06.png,their faith with cash .
b04-134-00.png,For expansion today means still greater
b04-134-01.png,"prosperity tomorrow . BERTRAND RUSSELL ,"
b04-134-02.png,the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
b04-134-03.png,"the-Bomb crusade , has devoted following ."
b04-134-04.png,Thousands march with him - and sit with him
b04-134-05.png,too . It is said by some that he is a saint ; by
b04-134-06.png,"others that he is a prophet . He is , in fact , a"
b04-134-07.png,philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
b04-134-08.png,who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
b04-134-09.png,issues of our time .
b04-140-00.png,BEFORE the war he urged the British people
b04-140-01.png,to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists .
b04-140-02.png,After the war he favoured a preventive war against
b04-140-03.png,Russia . Now he wants Britain to demolish her
b04-140-04.png,defences . Throughout the years Lord Russell
b04-140-05.png,and his supporters have been able to pursue their
b04-140-06.png,eccentric campaigns in freedom . They should
b04-140-07.png,ask themselves this question : How long would
b04-140-08.png,that freedom last if their policies were adopted ?
b04-147-00.png,AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity
b04-147-01.png,Board . The board is laying a cable along a seven-
b04-147-02.png,"mile route in Surrey . A warden , Mr. Jack Finlay ,"
b04-147-03.png,has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for
b04-147-04.png,householders when trenches are dug outside their
b04-147-05.png,front gates . Splendid . By showing concern
b04-147-06.png,for the people the board will earn their good will .
b04-147-07.png,"Happy patrolling , Mr. Finlay !"
b04-154-00.png,"GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky ! The tough ,"
b04-154-01.png,resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation
b04-154-02.png,shakes the life out of his critics . He calls them
b04-154-03.png,""" jelly-boned . "" He promises to preserve federation"
b04-154-04.png,against African fanatics and woolly minded
b04-154-05.png,individuals in the West . Some may ask : Is
b04-154-06.png,Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who
b04-154-07.png,disagree with him ? The facts answer that .
b04-162-00.png,"CONTRAST his firm , successful rule in Rhodesia"
b04-162-01.png,with what has happened in the Congo . There
b04-162-02.png,Welensky's opponents have carried their theories
b04-162-03.png,"into practice . There a UNO army of Africans ,"
b04-162-04.png,"bossed by an Indian , has been in charge for"
b04-162-05.png,months . And what has it made of the Congo ?
b04-162-06.png,A bloodstained shambles . No wonder
b04-162-07.png,Welensky has lost all patience with his
b04-162-08.png,misguided tormentors .
b04-169-00.png,They have earned his strictures . And his
b04-169-01.png,contempt . SOME people are for ever complaining
b04-169-02.png,that teenagers earn too much and spend it all
b04-169-03.png,when they get it . Now a survey of the Post
b04-169-04.png,Office Savings Bank shows how wrong that
b04-169-05.png,idea is . The biggest group of depositors in
b04-169-06.png,the bank is made of boys and girls aged 15
b04-169-07.png,to 19 .

b06-068-02.png,"Administration's sharpened policies , the"
b06-068-03.png,speeded-up drive to improve West
b06-068-04.png,"Germany's armament , the new attempt"
b06-068-05.png,to rush Britain into the European Common
b06-068-06.png,"Market , and the kite-flying on Spain"
b06-068-07.png,present a whole new proof that to abandon
b06-068-08.png,Scarborough is to expose Britain and her
b06-068-09.png,working class to sharp new dangers - that
b06-068-10.png,Gaitskellism is bankrupt .
b06-071-00.png,Ordinary working people will never
b06-071-01.png,rally to defend a policy founded on
b06-071-02.png,political chicanery or elect a Labour
b06-071-03.png,Government to carry through Tory policy -
b06-071-04.png,Gaitskell's stupid hope . The tragedy is
b06-071-05.png,that enormous inroads could already
b06-071-06.png,have been made into Tory strength by
b06-071-07.png,"a fighting policy , based on Scarborough ."
b06-071-08.png,THE desire for unity in the Labour and
b06-071-09.png,trade union movement following the
b06-075-00.png,At the same time that unity cannot be
b06-075-01.png,"established on a false basis , or by creating"
b06-075-02.png,further confusion within the movement . Unity
b06-075-03.png,will never be established on the basis of leaders
b06-075-04.png,being a law unto themselves and opposing
b06-075-05.png,conference decisions when it suits their own
b06-075-06.png,convenience . Unity can never be established by
b06-075-07.png,any formula uniting those who oppose German
b06-075-08.png,"troops being trained on British soil and Polaris ,"
b06-075-09.png,and those who are for this policy - which is the
b06-075-10.png,same as that of the Tory Government .
b06-079-00.png,It is impossible for Labour's new Defence state-
b06-079-01.png,ment to unite the movement as the Labour
b06-079-02.png,leaders are not only in favour of American
b06-079-03.png,"bases , but are in favour of German bases and"
b06-079-04.png,troops being trained on British soil . The new
b06-079-05.png,"Defence statement , while accepting that Britain can-"
b06-079-06.png,"not remain an independent nuclear Power , now"
b06-079-07.png,supports the policy of depending on American
b06-079-08.png,"nuclear weapons and the H-bomb , placing"
b06-079-09.png,Britain in an even more dangerous position .
b06-082-00.png,The statement of Padley and Crossman is no
b06-082-01.png,different in principle to the new defence statement .
b06-082-02.png,"They accept American nuclear bases , and also"
b06-082-03.png,the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy
b06-082-04.png,until some future date . They deceive the people
b06-082-05.png,by their talk of political and collective control
b06-082-06.png,of Nato . The Pentagon has made it perfectly
b06-082-07.png,"clear who controls the American H-bomb , and"
b06-082-08.png,who will actually give the instructions to press
b06-082-09.png,the button for nuclear warfare .
b06-087-00.png,There is only one way to develop unity and
b06-087-01.png,at the same time defend Britain . This
b06-087-02.png,was shown at the Scottish Trades Union
b06-087-03.png,"Congress , representing 800,000 organised"
b06-087-04.png,"trade unionists , when it decided by overwhelming"
b06-087-05.png,"votes , to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions"
b06-087-06.png,"on unilateral disarmament , and to oppose"
b06-087-07.png,Polaris and military bases being installed on
b06-087-08.png,"the Holy Loch , or any other part of Britain ."
b06-090-00.png,Such a policy would unite the whole movement
b06-090-01.png,and lay the basis for the defeat of the
b06-090-02.png,"present Tory Government , which has become a"
b06-090-03.png,real menace to the British people both in
b06-090-04.png,home and foreign policy . It is quite evident
b06-090-05.png,that the movement will go on record against
b06-090-06.png,the Polaris base and facilities for German bases
b06-090-07.png,and military training .
b06-093-00.png,This should strengthen the campaign to
b06-093-01.png,end the manufacture and use of
b06-093-02.png,nuclear weapons in Britain . Britain then
b06-093-03.png,could play a leading and independent
b06-093-04.png,role for an international agreement to ban
b06-093-05.png,all nuclear strategy and weapons of mass
b06-093-06.png,"destruction , and lay the basis for real"
b06-093-07.png,peace and progress . WHEN all the
b06-093-08.png,ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training
b06-093-09.png,Week subsides it is doubtful whether more
b06-093-10.png,than a handful of new apprenticeships
b06-097-00.png,This week of window dressing will not prevent
b06-097-01.png,most of the hopeful 15-year-olds leaving school
b06-097-02.png,in six weeks time from ending up in blind alley
b06-097-03.png,"jobs . It needs more than 10,000 church parades"
b06-097-04.png,"and open days at techs , more than descents into"
b06-097-05.png,Brighton's sewers or balloon ascents over
b06-097-06.png,Wolverhampton for Britain's technical training to
b06-097-07.png,catch up with the space age .
b06-100-00.png,"The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh ,"
b06-100-01.png,"opening a few technical college extensions ,"
b06-100-02.png,will not keep us abreast of the
b06-100-03.png,"scientific revolution . Out of the 550,000"
b06-100-04.png,young people aged 15-17 starting
b06-100-05.png,work in 1960 420000 ( 73 per cent )
b06-100-06.png,went into unskilled work . The per-
b06-100-07.png,centage is expected to swell to 80
b06-100-08.png,"next year . The Duke , possibly"
b06-100-09.png,"speaking from experience , stated :"
b06-110-00.png,But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
b06-110-01.png,prefer unskilled jobs . Countless numbers who want training
b06-110-02.png,are denied it . One area electricity board in 1958
b06-110-03.png,offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
b06-110-04.png,"applications , of whom 100 were considered suitable by"
b06-110-05.png,the board . There were only 17 vacancies for the 58
b06-110-06.png,boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth

c01-009-00.png,The production by Bill Duncalf
c01-009-01.png,compressed a long and sometimes rambling
c01-009-02.png,story into a concentrated comprehensive

c01-009-04.png,"HENZE'S "" Elegy for Young Lovers "" is the first"
c01-009-05.png,"unambiguously "" contemporary "" work to be"

c01-009-07.png,"means a masterpiece , it is in many respects"
c01-009-08.png,a representative modern work and the composer
c01-009-09.png,is a highly skilled manipulator of contemporary
c01-009-10.png,"idioms , with a strong sense of words and situation ."
c01-014-00.png,"The libretto , by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman ,"
c01-014-01.png,is largely a satire on the petty court
c01-014-02.png,"surrounding an ageing poet , whose deeply"
c01-014-03.png,egocentric character leads him to sacrifice
c01-014-04.png,everything to his need of inspiration . Henze
c01-014-05.png,obtains his musical characterisation by means
c01-014-06.png,"of individual instrumental timbres and "" personal """
c01-014-07.png,"intervals , and the result is often less delineation"
c01-014-08.png,"of character than caricature . This is also the chief ,"
c01-014-09.png,or at least the most successfully executed trait
c01-014-10.png,"of the libretto , which contains an odd blend of highly"
c01-066-00.png,The evil that Byron did certainly lived after
c01-066-01.png,"him , and was even outmatched by the"
c01-066-02.png,mischief perpetrated by almost every person
c01-066-03.png,who had been close to him . In turning over
c01-066-04.png,the bones Doris Langley Moore has brought
c01-066-05.png,to light a great deal of discreditable
c01-066-06.png,behaviour and a vision of mischief-
c01-066-07.png,making propensities of the leisured
c01-066-08.png,classes in the early 19th century which
c01-066-09.png,leaves one a little breathless .
c02-000-00.png,"AFTER ten days of intermittent , near fatal"
c02-000-01.png,"ennui , the eleventh Berlin International"
c02-000-02.png,Film Festival was suddenly jolted back to
c02-000-03.png,"life by two extraordinary films , Bernhard"
c02-000-04.png,"Wicki's "" Das Wunder des Malachias "" ( "" The"
c02-000-05.png,"Miracle of Father Malachias "" ) and Michael-"
c02-000-06.png,"angelo Antonioni's "" La Notte . "" The num-"
c02-000-07.png,ber of German film directors who have
c02-000-08.png,made first rate works in the last 25 years
c02-000-09.png,can be counted on the fingers of one
c02-003-00.png,It would now seem that Wicki's name must
c02-003-01.png,"be added to this list , for his new film"
c02-003-02.png,may well be a landmark in the revitali-
c02-003-03.png,sation of the German cinema . Wicki is
c02-003-04.png,not only a director . He began his career
c02-003-05.png,"as an actor , had his first important"
c02-003-06.png,"film ro*?5le in Ka""utner's "" Die letzt"
c02-003-07.png,"Bru""cke , "" and he also appears in the"
c02-003-08.png,new Antonioni film .
c02-007-00.png,In 1950 he began to take photographs not
c02-007-01.png,only in Germany but also in Africa and
c02-007-02.png,America . An exhibition of these works which
c02-007-03.png,is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im-
c02-007-04.png,"pressive . As Friedrich Du""rrenmatt , the Swiss"
c02-007-05.png,"playwright and author , wrote : "" Wicki's blacks"
c02-007-06.png,and greys are not only the colours of the
c02-007-07.png,"lost and the forgotten , but they are also the"
c02-007-08.png,technical means of abstraction .
c02-012-00.png,"Every unnecessary detail , all superfluous local"
c02-012-01.png,colouring must be eliminated . He does not
c02-012-02.png,"want the accuracy of a police photograph ,"
c02-012-03.png,but rather he wants to show the eternal in
c02-012-04.png,"every instant . "" The chilling horror of "" Mala-"
c02-012-05.png,"chias "" is due as much to Wicki the photo-"
c02-012-06.png,grapher as to Wicki the director . His earlier
c02-012-07.png,"film , "" Die Bru""cke , "" was equally terrifying ,"
c02-012-08.png,but here the director moves out of the world
c02-012-09.png,of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum
c02-017-00.png,Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with
c02-017-01.png,"considerable fidelity , the film tells the story"
c02-017-02.png,of a little monk who prays that a disrepu-
c02-017-03.png,table night club near his church be re-
c02-017-04.png,moved . One night his prayer is answered
c02-017-05.png,and the offending establishment is suddenly
c02-017-06.png,transplanted to an island in the North Sea .
c02-017-07.png,But Father Malachias's troubles have only
c02-017-08.png,"begun . Instead of having the desired effect ,"
c02-017-09.png,the miracle becomes exploited by a group
c02-022-00.png,Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of
c02-022-01.png,the missing building . The Church rebukes the
c02-022-02.png,"poor monk for his miracle , and as a"
c02-022-03.png,crowning indignity the night club is
c02-022-04.png,given a gala society reopening on the
c02-022-05.png,"island . Father Malachias goes to the island ,"
c02-022-06.png,"prays , and in a second miracle the"
c02-022-07.png,night club is replaced in its original
c02-022-08.png,setting .
c02-026-00.png,A summary of the story can give almost
c02-026-01.png,indication of the scope of Wicki's artistry . He
c02-026-02.png,"tells his story best in the faces of his crowds ,"
c02-026-03.png,recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat
c02-026-04.png,"with brutal honesty , building up to a"
c02-026-05.png,tremendous climax in the island orgy .
c02-026-06.png,"Here , the guests arrive in ghost-like yachts ,"
c02-026-07.png,the wildly flapping white sails slashed by
c02-026-08.png,the glaring beacon of a lighthouse .
c02-030-00.png,"When the final miracle does occur , it is accepted as a"
c02-030-01.png,marvellous joke ; no one has learned anything . Wicki
c02-030-02.png,suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue . In
c02-030-03.png,complete silence he shows the faces of people
c02-030-04.png,"walking in the streets , smug , content , satisfied ,"
c02-030-05.png,and thoroughly frightening . Wicki has
c02-030-06.png,succeeded in his second film in
c02-030-07.png,recording his personal apocalypse of the
c02-030-08.png,last days of a sick society .
c02-035-00.png,"It is most unfair to call "" Malachias "" a cut-rate"
c02-035-01.png,""" Dolce Vita , "" for it is far more intimate and deeply"
c02-035-02.png,felt . In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat
c02-035-03.png,"in "" Titanic "" by paralleling the last days of the"
c02-035-04.png,"Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner ,"
c02-035-05.png,and paid for his audacity with his life .
c02-049-00.png,"Strangely enough , the Berlin audience received"
c02-049-01.png,"the film with extreme coolness , much preferring"
c02-049-02.png,"Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing "" Une Femme"
c02-049-03.png,"est une Femme , "" a ninety-one minute hymn"
c02-049-04.png,"to "" Vogue , "" "" Cahiers du Cinema , "" and the"
c02-049-05.png,worst aspects of the American cinema . From
c02-049-06.png,"a brilliantly funny start , the work fizzles"
c02-049-07.png,out into a series of repetitious sight-gags
c02-049-08.png,and personal jokes incomprehensible to the
c02-049-09.png,uninitiated ( including four plugs for Charles
c02-049-10.png,Aznavour ) .
c02-056-00.png,This director is at last being re-evaluated and
c02-056-01.png,given his proper place in the history of the
c02-056-02.png,German film . Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
c02-056-03.png,""" Unheimliche Geschichten "" ( 1920 ) , five ghost stories"
c02-056-04.png,"with a light touch , and there was much to admire"
c02-056-05.png,"in "" Dreyfus "" ( 1930 ) and the virtually unknown"
c02-056-06.png,"but extremely important "" 1914 "" ( 1931 ) , which"
c02-056-07.png,tries to show that it took more than just
c02-056-08.png,Germany to start the First World War .

c02-059-01.png,"Prizes being what they are , Berlin is unusually"
c02-059-02.png,"generous in giving everyone something , and silver"
c02-059-03.png,bears are awarded in every direction . Both the
c02-059-04.png,"Antonioni and Wicki films took high honours ,"
c02-059-05.png,and the audience at the awards was particularly
c02-059-06.png,enthusiastic when one Miss Anna Kerima was selected

c04-061-00.png,Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble
c04-061-01.png,as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable . They
c04-061-02.png,alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
c04-061-03.png,through the gormless standing corn around them . Perhaps
c04-061-04.png,it was accidental - I hope not . If ever a bag of

d01-019-04.png,"accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he"
d01-019-05.png,"could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order ."
d01-024-00.png,Most of those who expound a theory of textual
d01-024-01.png,dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
d01-024-02.png,written entirely by one author before the
d01-024-03.png,disturbance took place but a few leave it open
d01-024-04.png,to suppose that the original book had been
d01-024-05.png,revised even before the upheaval . The ingenuity
d01-024-06.png,of the theories is impressive and is the best
d01-024-07.png,argument against them .
d01-024-08.png,Thomas Spreng
d01-049-00.png,The one real weakness of the Commentator's
d01-049-01.png,"case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,"
d01-049-02.png,"he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly"
d01-049-03.png,how this enlargement was effected nor has he
d01-049-04.png,been able to explain the textual movements by
d01-049-05.png,showing that such changes are part of a
d01-049-06.png,simple and coherent plan . To understand how
d01-049-07.png,this is possible it is necessary to examine the
d01-049-08.png,text of the Gospel .
d01-052-00.png,THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
d01-052-01.png,written in Greek . A modern text of the
d01-052-02.png,Gospel represents the work of generations of
d01-052-03.png,scholars who have compared the many manu-
d01-052-04.png,scripts of John and worked out the version
d01-052-05.png,which is most likely to have been the original
d01-052-06.png,wording . It is not possible to establish any one
d01-052-07.png,text with absolute precision .
d01-056-00.png,The most convenient one for the authors
d01-056-01.png,has been the text of A. Souter . In this
d01-056-02.png,version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
d01-056-03.png,"printed as just over 1,000 different nouns ,"
d01-056-04.png,"verbs , and other parts of speech occurring"
d01-056-05.png,"15,695 times in their different grammatical"
d01-056-06.png,forms . There are other texts which could
d01-056-07.png,"have been used , and ( as shown in Table 1 )"
d01-056-08.png,it is not a matter of the greatest importance
d01-056-09.png,which text is used .
d01-060-00.png,At first sight the difference between
d01-060-01.png,Souter and the other texts is rather
d01-060-02.png,large . But the British text includes
d01-060-03.png,"the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman"
d01-060-04.png,"taken in Adultery , and this accounts"
d01-060-05.png,"for 178 words out of 279 , which is"
d01-060-06.png,"the difference between the 15,695 words"
d01-060-07.png,"of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's ."
d01-060-08.png,The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
d01-060-09.png,is a matter of editorial decision rather
d01-080-00.png,"The bar was the commonest marking , but others"
d01-080-01.png,were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the
d01-080-02.png,"bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as"
d01-080-03.png,it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently
d01-080-04.png,paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of
d01-080-05.png,the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
d01-080-06.png,"some markings would be used , although which , it is"
d01-080-07.png,impossible to say .
d01-085-00.png,Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
d01-085-01.png,the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The
d01-085-02.png,"original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,"
d01-085-03.png,"whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in"
d01-085-04.png,columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient
d01-085-05.png,manuscripts . A common size of column would hold
d01-085-06.png,about one third of a page of Souter's print .
d01-098-00.png,The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
d01-098-01.png,and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made
d01-098-02.png,a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number
d01-098-03.png,which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
d01-098-04.png,this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It
d01-098-05.png,"was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not"
d01-098-06.png,an easy form of book in which to find a
d01-098-07.png,reference .
d01-104-00.png,This last objection might have had some weight in
d01-104-01.png,"ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,"
d01-104-02.png,the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
d01-104-03.png,As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01-104-04.png,"overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his"
d01-104-05.png,information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
d01-104-06.png,The other form of book was the codex . In this the
d01-104-07.png,sheets were bound together down one edge much as
d01-104-08.png,they are in modern books .
d01-118-00.png,Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
d01-118-01.png,might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell
d01-118-02.png,whether or not a particular text was written on
d01-118-03.png,a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for
d01-118-04.png,"writing , but any papyrus left unused at the"
d01-118-05.png,end could be cut off . If the text was longer than
d01-118-06.png,"the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on ."
d01-123-00.png,"The verso of the roll was blank , and one"
d01-123-01.png,"cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,"
d01-123-02.png,"sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,"
d01-123-03.png,while one whole side of his roll was unused .
d01-123-04.png,The codex form was not so accommodating . Even
d01-123-05.png,"in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra"
d01-123-06.png,sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
d01-123-07.png,"over the binding , or the whole codex rebound ."
d03-112-00.png,Close to the building projects would be the
d03-112-01.png,VINEYARDS ( 1 Kings 4.25 ; S. of Sol. 8.11 ) .
d03-112-02.png,"The word is a Persian loan-word ,"
d03-112-03.png,"pairi-deaza , from which our word paradise"
d03-112-04.png,is derived . Qoheleth has a second
d03-112-05.png,paradise at his disposal but he is
d03-112-06.png,no happier than Adam was !
d03-112-07.png,The word is used in the singular
d03-112-08.png,in Neh. 2.8 and S. of Sol. 4.13 .
d03-117-00.png,A natural transition from gardens and
d03-117-01.png,orchards to the vital question of water
d03-117-02.png,supply . The pools are probably natural springs
d03-117-03.png,enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
d03-117-04.png,the rock . King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
d03-117-05.png,"construction in lines 9 , 23-25 of the Moabite Stone ,"
d03-117-06.png,which read : And I built Baal-meon and made
d03-117-07.png,in it the reservoir ... and I made both the
d03-117-08.png,reservoirs for water inside the town .
d04-005-00.png,"According to the legend , Solomon had asked the"
d04-005-01.png,"Prince of the Demons , "" Ashmodeus "" to bring him"
d04-005-02.png,the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the
d04-005-03.png,"Shamir had not been placed under his charge , as"
d04-005-04.png,there is no Shamir in Gehenna ( Hell ) . An eagle
d04-005-05.png,"brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden ,"
d04-005-06.png,"the Paradise , the only place where the Shamir"
d04-005-07.png,could be found .
d04-008-00.png,The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in
d04-008-01.png,"a sanctuary , and only some rare birds know"
d04-008-02.png,"the existence of it . These birds are , the Cherubim"
d04-008-03.png,and the Seraphim . We are also told that the Shamir
d04-008-04.png,"is the stylus used by Moses , and this stylus is described"
d04-008-05.png,as a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant .
d04-012-00.png,The word Shamir was used as a
d04-012-01.png,personal name ( Git. 68a ) . The Hebrew
d04-012-02.png,"word "" SHAMIR "" means guarded or preser-"
d04-012-03.png,"ved . Therefore , the real man , who"
d04-012-04.png,"regards himself as insignificant , as the"
d04-012-05.png,"prayer says : "" What am I ? A worm "" , he"
d04-012-06.png,is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
d04-012-07.png,"the Shmah , loves the Lord God with"
d04-012-08.png,"all his heart , and with all his soul and"
d04-012-09.png,with all his might and studies the
d04-012-10.png,word of God .
d04-016-00.png,"This man is the worm , the creature that"
d04-016-01.png,cuts and polishes Altar-Stones . Such
d04-016-02.png,a man is the Shamir that guards him-
d04-016-03.png,self against all the irrelevant pleasures .
d04-016-04.png,Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
d04-016-05.png,"to mould our character , to melt our"
d04-016-06.png,heart of stone . This Shamir helps
d04-016-07.png,us earthly creatures to build an Altar
d04-016-08.png,for God to come nearer to God .
d04-021-00.png,The action of the Shamir writes books and their
d04-021-01.png,books are readable . This Shamir is indeed a rare
d04-021-02.png,"diamond that incises the hardest rock , the hardest"
d04-021-03.png,facts . And these creatures existed from the
d04-021-04.png,"beginning . It is "" the stone , which the builders"
d04-021-05.png,"refused , but it is to become the head-stone"
d04-021-06.png,"of the corner "" . ( Ps. 118 , 22 . ) And the stone shall"
d04-021-07.png,tell !

d04-028-05.png,filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the

d04-032-00.png,"The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue ,"
d04-032-01.png,"which is written on two plates , the hard facts"
d04-032-02.png,"of life , and all facts are "" one "" . We have all"
d04-032-03.png,come across human Shamirs and they leave
d04-032-04.png,a deep impression on our feelings and senses .
d04-032-05.png,They make us the Altar for God to emit
d04-032-06.png,the Light which can be read in every
d04-032-07.png,"language . The Shamir is the "" seventh "" and"
d04-032-08.png,"most important creature , that was created on"
d04-032-09.png,"the eve of the Sabbath , to bring the"
d04-032-10.png,"Sabbath , real peace to the whole world ."
d04-037-00.png,"Then the whole earth will be His Altar . "" And it"

d04-047-01.png,mind together we cannot solve the further
d04-047-02.png,"summons of destiny , to solve the economic"

d05-008-00.png,The new century opened with James 1 ascending
d05-008-01.png,the throne . He was quite prepared to be
d05-008-02.png,tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
d05-008-03.png,"spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for"
d05-008-04.png,"James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,"
d05-008-05.png,"but those hopes were dashed . True , a new Prayer"
d05-008-06.png,Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
d05-008-07.png,derived little comfort from it .
d05-013-00.png,They objected to the word Absolution . So the phrase ' or
d05-013-01.png,the remission of sins ' was added . But Absolution remained .
d05-013-02.png,They objected to the word Confirmation . So the phrase
d05-013-03.png,' or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
d05-013-04.png,able to render an account of their faith according
d05-013-05.png,to the Catechism following ' were added . But Confirmation
d05-013-06.png,remained . Other changes in the Book were equally
d05-013-07.png,minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
d05-013-08.png,added to the Catechism .
d05-021-00.png,This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
d05-021-01.png,"been the mood which produced the Black Rubric , for"
d05-021-02.png,"it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ , which are"
d05-021-03.png,verily and indeed taken and received by the
d05-021-04.png,faithful in the Lord's Supper . ' It could hardly be more
d05-021-05.png,"definite . It was at this time , too , that King James made"
d05-021-06.png,himself immortal by becoming associated with
d05-021-07.png,a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
d05-021-08.png,( which was never actually authorized ! ) .
d05-025-00.png,In that year Shakespeare had just turned
d05-025-01.png,forty and had written Hamlet two years
d05-025-02.png,before . Bacon was at work and Milton was
d05-025-03.png,just learning to read . James was followed by
d05-025-04.png,"Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish"
d05-025-05.png,Prayer Book in 1637 . Significantly this made
d05-025-06.png,a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
d05-025-07.png,became the foster mother of some of the most
d05-025-08.png,important Prayer Books in the Anglican
d05-025-09.png,Communion .
d05-030-00.png,"Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,"
d05-030-01.png,now so much nobler a figure than former historians
d05-030-02.png,led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated
d05-030-03.png,"by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was"
d05-030-04.png,mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his
d05-030-05.png,first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
d05-030-06.png,"the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly"
d05-030-07.png,"with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,"
d05-030-08.png,was necessarily a menace .
d05-040-00.png,Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church ?
d05-040-01.png,Laud made a positive approach . He set out to increase
d05-040-02.png,a sense of reverence . The Prayer Book was to be respected
d05-040-03.png,and so was the office of a bishop . Altars should be
d05-040-04.png,"altars and not any broken down , transportable"
d05-040-05.png,table which was handy for the most improbable uses .
d06-000-00.png,In the first place it is not a great deal
d06-000-01.png,"of use telling even children , as I have"
d06-000-02.png,"already suggested , not to be silly or"
d06-000-03.png,to pull themselves together . Far better
d06-000-04.png,to help them to face whatever it is that
d06-000-05.png,"is worrying them , to find the original"
d06-000-06.png,cause and then deal with it ; show it
d06-000-07.png,up either for the sham it is - and many
d06-000-08.png,fears are based upon completely
d06-000-09.png,irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
d06-003-00.png,Even worse is to laugh . Tremendous damage may be done to a child
d06-003-01.png,"by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know"
d06-003-02.png,"that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable ,"
d06-003-03.png,but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting
d06-003-04.png,that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
d06-003-05.png,"to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the"
d06-003-06.png,other side as victors .
d06-008-00.png,To ridicule them only pushes them farther
d06-008-01.png,"into themselves , so that they become"
d06-008-02.png,unable to speak about it to anybody and
d06-008-03.png,"the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,"
d06-008-04.png,the harvest of which may still be being
d06-008-05.png,reaped at forty or fifty . Far better to
d06-008-06.png,agree with a child that a particular
d06-008-07.png,"situation is frightening , and then to face"
d06-008-08.png,it together until the child can see how
d06-008-09.png,unnecessary its fears were .
d06-011-00.png,Because situations which may contain
d06-011-01.png,"all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,"
d06-011-02.png,it is a good idea to condition a child
d06-011-03.png,to some extent against it . To keep a child
d06-011-04.png,of twelve or thirteen under the
d06-011-05.png,impression that nothing nasty ever
d06-011-06.png,"happens is not merely dishonest , it"
d06-011-07.png,is unwise . As I shall suggest in a
d06-011-08.png,later chapter there are some situations
d06-011-09.png,which occur less frequently than
d06-015-00.png,"A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into"
d06-015-01.png,"too many details , would help many a child to make a"
d06-015-02.png,proper adjustment to life as it grows up . Let us look
d06-015-03.png,"at Jesus . We do not , I think , see there a life without fear ."
d06-015-04.png,There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
d06-015-05.png,on .
d06-020-00.png,In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
d06-020-01.png,should pass from Him . Jesus shows us
d06-020-02.png,the way to face life . To see all the latent
d06-020-03.png,frightening possibilities and yet by facing
d06-020-04.png,them and knowing God is with us and
d06-020-05.png,"that , with Him , there is nothing that can"
d06-020-06.png,"finally defeat us . More than that , that God"
d06-020-07.png,has something important to do with our
d06-020-08.png,"lives and that the nearer we get to Him ,"
d06-020-09.png,the stronger we become .
d06-025-00.png,... Today A wonderful thought In the
d06-025-01.png,dawn was given ... And the thought
d06-025-02.png,Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in
d06-025-03.png,"my hand ; That my hand is big Big ,"
d06-025-04.png,"Because of the plan That God , Who"
d06-025-05.png,"dwells in my hand , Knows this"
d06-025-06.png,"secret plan , Of the things He will"
d06-025-07.png,do for the world Using my hand .
d06-027-00.png,"Toyohiko Kagawa . Loving Saviour , who experienced"
d06-027-01.png,"all human emotion , and whose sensitive"
d06-027-02.png,"nature knows better than we do , what it is to"
d06-027-03.png,"be really afraid , help us to know that when"
d06-027-04.png,"we face life boldly , many of the shadows are"
d06-027-05.png,"seen to be allies and not enemies and that ,"
d06-027-06.png,"come what may , we are never alone when"
d06-027-07.png,we are with Thee .
d06-030-00.png,Amen . MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
d06-030-01.png,purely physical thing . The cure for which is sleep . This is only
d06-030-02.png,partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
d06-030-03.png,"amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be"
d06-030-04.png,"effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes"
d06-030-05.png,from innocence .
d06-037-00.png,"To others , the long hours of the night bring"
d06-037-01.png,only a disturbed tossing and turning
d06-037-02.png,which causes them to wake feeling worse
d06-037-03.png,than when they went to bed . We may begin
d06-037-04.png,to understand this a little better when we
d06-037-05.png,realize that tiredness itself is largely in
d06-037-06.png,"the mind . Very few people , under normal"
d06-037-07.png,"conditions , work themselves to a standstill ."
d06-041-00.png,The mind tires first and conveys the impression
d06-041-01.png,of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by
d06-041-02.png,noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
d06-041-03.png,body who feels thoroughly tired . Suppose
d06-041-04.png,a mother has news late at night that her
d06-041-05.png,child is in danger . She will undertake a
d06-041-06.png,"journey which , an hour before , she would"
d06-041-07.png,have declared impossible .
d06-046-00.png,"Even more simply , test your own reactions"
d06-046-01.png,to different situations . There are some which
d06-046-02.png,bring on an almost immediate feeling of
d06-046-03.png,tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
d06-046-04.png,"the washing-up - while others , if they"
d06-046-05.png,"refer to something you like doing , bring a"
d06-046-06.png,veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who
d06-046-07.png,is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump
d06-046-08.png,up with no apparent tiredness at all when
d06-046-09.png,her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
d06-050-00.png,Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . She really did feel tired
d06-050-01.png,until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
d06-050-02.png,"attractive - interest ! Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do"
d06-050-03.png,with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . A
d06-050-04.png,disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
d06-050-05.png,"of fatigue . They wonder why they get no rest at night ,"
d06-050-06.png,even if they do sleep .
d06-056-00.png,They drag themselves around and can become
d06-056-01.png,a burden to their families and their friends .
d06-056-02.png,Any mental confusion can cause this and
d06-056-03.png,the best way is probably to seek advice .
d06-056-04.png,As we are unable to cure our own bodies
d06-056-05.png,"if the cause of our pain is too deep seated ,"
d06-056-06.png,"so we are unable to cure our own minds ,"
d06-056-07.png,if the trouble is a complicated one
d06-056-08.png,involving careful and patient treatment .
d06-060-00.png,One of the greatest steps forward that has been
d06-060-01.png,made this century is the way in which illness
d06-060-02.png,"of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,"
d06-060-03.png,and is in fact no differently regarded than
d06-060-04.png,"physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a"
d06-060-05.png,great deal of tiredness which comes from
d06-060-06.png,no major complication but results from an
d06-060-07.png,"inability to deal with life , especially under"
d06-060-08.png,the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
d06-060-09.png,century .
d06-063-00.png,"In the days when most people were born ,"
d06-063-01.png,lived and died within the boundaries of
d06-063-02.png,"the village , it was not difficult for anybody"
d06-063-03.png,to live a day at a time . Even those who
d06-063-04.png,held a high and responsible office lived in
d06-063-05.png,far greater simplicity than their successors .
d06-063-06.png,"When news from the Continent took days ,"
d06-063-07.png,"from America weeks , from the Far East ,"
d06-063-08.png,"months , even a Prime Minister could go to"
d06-063-09.png,sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
d06-063-10.png,"be happening at the other end of England ,"
d06-067-00.png,"In other ways , too , life for the ordinary"
d06-067-01.png,individual has become so complex
d06-067-02.png,that it taxes the mind . Two hundred
d06-067-03.png,"years ago , men lived and worked"
d06-067-04.png,"in one place , their lives were of one"
d06-067-05.png,"piece . Now a man may live twenty ,"
d06-067-06.png,thirty even sixty miles from his
d06-067-07.png,work . The only connexion is the
d06-067-08.png,pipeline of the railway on which they
d06-067-09.png,travel day by day .
d06-072-00.png,"In many cases , their homes know little of"
d06-072-01.png,their place of work and their associates at
d06-072-02.png,the office or works wonder what they
d06-072-03.png,are possibly like in the surroundings of their
d06-072-04.png,"homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead"
d06-072-05.png,a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
d06-072-06.png,planning to do so or in fact being conscious
d06-072-07.png,of what is going on . It is easier to live life in
d06-072-08.png,"compartments but over the years it builds up ,"
d06-072-09.png,and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
d06-072-10.png,need to be handled correctly .
d06-076-00.png,Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life
d06-076-01.png,"as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un-"
d06-076-02.png,necessary weariness . ( a ) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness .
d06-076-03.png,We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet ' . Time
d06-076-04.png,after time we forget something and have to go back
d06-076-05.png,upstairs or down to the shops .
d06-082-00.png,If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -
d06-082-01.png,we lose this way in the course of a day we would be
d06-082-02.png,"staggered . Some of it is inevitable , and we do not want to"
d06-082-03.png,"become too pernickety . Nevertheless , we could all probably"
d06-082-04.png,be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle
d06-082-05.png,through .
d06-086-00.png,The housewife would find life far less tiring
d06-086-01.png,"if she made a list , followed a routine of work"
d06-086-02.png,rather than getting from one thing to the next .
d06-086-03.png,The business man would find that he reached
d06-086-04.png,the end of the day with far less strain if
d06-086-05.png,he was a little more systematic . To drift
d06-086-06.png,aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
d06-086-07.png,thing else . If we would only sit down and
d06-086-08.png,write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
d06-086-09.png,"be done and then work quietly through them ,"
d06-086-10.png,we would find life considerably less exhausting
d06-091-00.png,There may be some who will argue that
d06-091-01.png,"routine destroys the soul . It is so easy ,"
d06-091-02.png,"they say , to get into a rut . Save us"
d06-091-03.png,from the school curriculum and even
d06-091-04.png,worse the school system whereby for
d06-091-05.png,meals everybody knows beforehand
d06-091-06.png,"exactly what , on any given day of the"
d06-091-07.png,"week , they are going to have . If - such"
d06-091-08.png,a critic may say - you are calling
d06-091-09.png,"us to adventure , do not strangle us before"
d06-091-10.png,we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
d06-096-00.png,I am more than conscious of this . How anybody
d06-096-01.png,can go through the same routine day in and day
d06-096-02.png,out for forty years I find difficult to understand .
d06-096-03.png,A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
d06-096-04.png,commerce may be kept going - though if ever
d06-096-05.png,it becomes possible to work out a system
d06-096-06.png,of ' staggered ' hours it may do an immense
d06-096-07.png,amount of good over and above relieving
d06-096-08.png,the pressure on over-crowded trains .
d06-100-00.png,"As it is , with so much of our life already"
d06-100-01.png,"in a predetermined groove , I would"
d06-100-02.png,hardly like to add further to the dullness
d06-100-03.png,which it engenders . But I am not arguing
d06-100-04.png,for this . I know how much of a drag it can be
d06-100-05.png,and I was interested some little while
d06-100-06.png,ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
d06-100-07.png,day timetable .
d06-104-00.png,"They only worked , of course , a five-"
d06-104-01.png,day week so that in the first week
d06-104-02.png,Monday to Friday were days one
d06-104-03.png,"to five of the timetable , the following"
d06-104-04.png,Monday was day six and Tuesday
d06-104-05.png,started day one again and so on .
d06-104-06.png,By this means they avoided each
d06-104-07.png,week being the same with a pupil
d06-104-08.png,knowing exactly what the subject
d06-104-09.png,would be on Friday afternoon at
d06-104-10.png,3 p.m. .
d06-107-00.png,"It was a little complicated to work ,"
d06-107-01.png,"of course , and there had to be a big"
d06-107-02.png,notice in the entrance saying which
d06-107-03.png,day of the timetable it was - but
d06-107-04.png,it added immensely to the interest
d06-107-05.png,and kept everybody on their toes .
d06-107-06.png,To have order does not mean getting
d06-107-07.png,into a dull routine . I have great
d06-107-08.png,sympathy with the young wife
d06-107-09.png,who does not always want to do
d06-107-10.png,the washing on a Monday .
d06-111-00.png,"I would not want to either , but if she wants to get through"
d06-111-01.png,"the day without becoming exhausted , she will be well advised to"
d06-111-02.png,sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
d06-111-03.png,"do , note the order in which they can most conveniently be"
d06-111-04.png,done ( or must be done because of other predetermined factors
d06-111-05.png,"- you must , for example , do your shopping on the morning of"
d06-111-06.png,the early closing day ) .
d06-113-00.png,"She will , in fact , be surprised at what peace"
d06-113-01.png,of mind ensues . ( b ) Concentrate on one
d06-113-02.png,thing at a time . A list or a plan enables us to
d06-113-03.png,put all our energies into the particular
d06-113-04.png,matter on hand .
d07-082-00.png,"( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof"
d07-082-01.png,"texts and the Gemara explains why these ,"
d07-082-02.png,"too , are necessary , but a careful examination"
d07-082-03.png,of that passage makes it clear that these are
d07-082-04.png,not quoted here because they are not
d07-082-05.png,necessary to prove the point made by
d07-082-06.png,"R. Joshua b. Levi . ) Finally , we note that"
d07-082-07.png,the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
d07-082-08.png,elsewhere .
d07-085-00.png,"From the above it follows that here , once again ,"
d07-085-01.png,we have a good illustration of how a
d07-085-02.png,sugya has been fashioned from material
d07-085-03.png,already in the hands of the Redactors .
d07-085-04.png,The sugya is built around the saying of
d07-085-05.png,R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the
d07-085-06.png,reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
d07-085-07.png,with the comment given by Samuel .
d07-089-00.png,( This is probably to be understood as a well-
d07-089-01.png,known comment on the verse ; quoted by
d07-089-02.png,Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
d07-089-03.png,by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
d07-089-04.png,Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by
d07-089-05.png,the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah .
d07-089-06.png,There is no reference to the Mishnah here
d07-089-07.png,because the Mishnah deals with the
d07-089-08.png,actual practice of greeting by the divine
d07-089-09.png,Name and the Gemara here quotes the
d07-089-10.png,texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi .
d07-093-00.png,The question and answer with regard to the
d07-093-01.png,need for the text of the angel are quoted
d07-093-02.png,here in the same words in which they are
d07-093-03.png,quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
d07-093-04.png,This can either mean that both sugyas are
d07-093-05.png,quoting a well-known question and
d07-093-06.png,answer or that our sugya is quoting from
d07-093-07.png,the longer sugya which deals with all
d07-093-08.png,four texts quoted in the Mishnah .
d07-096-00.png,Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
d07-096-01.png,original question and answer and this is quoted
d07-096-02.png,in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the
d07-096-03.png,use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own
d07-096-04.png,accord but there was no approval of his action
d07-096-05.png,in Heaven ' in both sugyoth . Such an
d07-096-06.png,expression appears to have been framed in
d07-096-07.png,"response to the particular point at issue here ,"
d07-096-08.png,whether the Heavenly Court concurred
d07-096-09.png,in the decision of the human court . )
d07-100-00.png,The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
d07-100-01.png,is then quoted and the interpretation of the
d07-100-02.png,latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
d07-100-03.png,"is added , not because this is at all relevant"
d07-100-04.png,to the discussion but because it was
d07-100-05.png,a familiar interpretation which had
d07-100-06.png,become so well known that it was
d07-100-07.png,invariably quoted whenever the verse
d07-100-08.png,"itself was quoted , almost as if it were a"
d07-100-09.png,part of the verse .
d07-102-00.png,The Gemara continues with a saying of the
d07-102-01.png,"Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) :"
d07-102-02.png,' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places :
d07-102-03.png,"the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah ,"
d07-102-04.png,and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this
d07-102-05.png,"saying here is obvious , it follows naturally"
d07-102-06.png,on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
d07-102-07.png,deals with a similar theme .
e01-014-00.png,We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
e01-014-01.png,that he was a great man for lace - paying
e01-014-02.png,as much as 3 for a lace collar . But this
e01-014-03.png,didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
e01-014-04.png,"for his lady , for he records testily : ' My wife"
e01-014-05.png,and I fell out about my not being willing
e01-014-06.png,to have her gown laced . '
e01-018-00.png,"We read , with sympathy , an advertisement in the"
e01-018-01.png,reign of Charles 2 stating : ' Lost : a lawn 1hand-
e01-018-02.png,kercher with a broad hem laced round with
e01-018-03.png,fine Point lace about four fingers broad ' and
e01-018-04.png,among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
e01-018-05.png,unpaid bill for ' scarlet satin shoes with
e01-018-06.png,silver lace ' . The records of these tender trifles
e01-018-07.png,are very touching but then lace does place
e01-018-08.png,upon everything a delicate sentiment .
e01-022-00.png,Lucky indeed are the families that
e01-022-01.png,possess a heritage of lace . A lace
e01-022-02.png,bridal veil handed down from mother
e01-022-03.png,"to daughters , a lace-trimmed Christening"
e01-022-04.png,robe that each generation wears in turn -
e01-022-05.png,"these are proud possessions , linked to the"
e01-022-06.png,exquisite lace-making of the past .
e01-025-00.png,But lace-making is by no means a lost
e01-025-01.png,art . It suffered a decline and fell into
e01-025-02.png,lamentably low standards in the fussy
e01-025-03.png,over-furnishing of the Victorian age
e01-025-04.png,but it would take more than a temporary
e01-025-05.png,"lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely ,"
e01-025-06.png,"viable craft . It has , in fact , readily"
e01-025-07.png,adapted itself to modern tastes and the ill-
e01-025-08.png,ustrations in the following pages will show
e01-025-09.png,how completely it is in sympathy with con-
e01-025-10.png,temporary surroundings .
e01-029-00.png,"It will be seen how , with bold design"
e01-029-01.png,"and rich colour , knitting , crochet and"
e01-029-02.png,tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons
e01-029-03.png,can give striking individuality to many things
e01-029-04.png,"in the home . Chairbacks , cushions , tablecloths ,"
e01-029-05.png,to mention only three - how satisfying it is
e01-029-06.png,to avoid the ready-made in these and by
e01-029-07.png,one's own handiwork produce something
e01-029-08.png,that reflects true creative talent .
e01-032-00.png,The more delicate patterns and finer
e01-032-01.png,threads may be reserved to bring a light
e01-032-02.png,and lovely touch to personal possessions -
e01-032-03.png,"a lace border to a handkerchief , fine-lace"
e01-032-04.png,"insertion on a petticoat or blouse , a tatted edge"
e01-032-05.png,"to a collar ; these add a charming , feminine"
e01-032-06.png,distinction that nothing else can give .
e01-032-07.png,Although we assess lace-making as one of
e01-032-08.png,"the feminine skills , a number of the well-loved"
e01-032-09.png,"traditional patterns that we follow today were ,"
e01-032-10.png,"in fact , the brain-children of inventive men ."
e01-035-00.png,"For in the old order of things , men designed"
e01-035-01.png,and worked lace as well as women and
e01-035-02.png,special schools were set up to teach lace-
e01-035-03.png,"making not only to young girls , but to little"
e01-035-04.png,boys as well . Whole families made their
e01-035-05.png,livelihood by lace-making and consequently
e01-035-06.png,"a folklore of song , festival and courtship grew"
e01-035-07.png,up around the lace industry .
e01-050-00.png,During the sixteenth century a considerable
e01-050-01.png,amount of crochet was produced in the
e01-050-02.png,convents of Europe . Without doubt it was the
e01-050-03.png,nuns who carried the craft to Ireland . There it
e01-050-04.png,was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
e01-050-05.png,"form with rosettes , leaves and lace fillings . During"
e01-050-06.png,the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
e01-050-07.png,greatly abused .
e01-055-00.png,One can remember with horror the pictures of the
e01-055-01.png,overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
e01-055-02.png,"complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel-"
e01-055-03.png,piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
e01-055-04.png,numerous other crocheted pieces . It was some years
e01-055-05.png,after the Victorian period that designers realised
e01-055-06.png,"the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was"
e01-055-07.png,revived with designs suitable for contemporary
e01-055-08.png,"trends . Crochet today has a variety of uses , and"
e01-055-09.png,has even stepped into the field of high fashion .
e01-059-00.png,In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris
e01-059-01.png,"hand-crocheted blouses , gossamer fine in"
e01-059-02.png,"texture , are sold at a very high price . With a"
e01-059-03.png,little time and concentration the woman at home can
e01-059-04.png,produce fashion articles as elegant as those of
e01-059-05.png,"Paris - a blouse , delicate gloves or a fine"
e01-059-06.png,"edging for collar , cuffs or a handkerchief ."
e01-062-00.png,"In the home , crochet lace can be used to make"
e01-062-01.png,"tablecloths , traycloths and runners , and edgings"
e01-062-02.png,from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
e01-062-03.png,functions . The art of crochet is not difficult and
e01-062-04.png,it is reasonably quick to work . In the following
e01-062-05.png,pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
e01-062-06.png,to enable the beginner to master all the essential
e01-062-07.png,crochet stitches .
e01-081-00.png,First launder crochet and then pin to the required
e01-081-01.png,"shape , ensuring that all lines of the crochet are"
e01-081-02.png,accurate . Place crochet in correct position on linen and
e01-081-03.png,secure with pins . Run a line of basting stitches
e01-081-04.png,on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
e01-081-05.png,which are to be attached to the linen . Remove crochet .
e01-086-00.png,Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen :
e01-086-01.png,"( a ) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches ,"
e01-086-02.png,the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the
e01-086-03.png,outside edge . Oversew crochet to button stitch .
e01-086-04.png,"( b ) Turn under a small hem , with fold lying on line"
e01-086-05.png,of basting stitches . Work a row of dc all round
e01-086-06.png,"this hem , with 3 dc at each corner ."
e01-092-00.png,"Oversew crochet to the dc. A household word ,"
e01-092-01.png,Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities which
e01-092-02.png,are of the utmost importance to the worker .
e01-092-03.png,"It washes beautifully , never loses its colour"
e01-092-04.png,"nor becomes ' stringy ' , is very elastic and"
e01-092-05.png,preserves the beauty of the design . It is easy
e01-092-06.png,"to work with , soft , glossy and of uniform"
e01-092-07.png,thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread .
e01-102-00.png,Remember that texture plays an important part in
e01-102-01.png,the beauty of crochet . The finer mercerised threads
e01-102-02.png,are more effective for the delicate designs used for
e01-102-03.png,"tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while"
e01-102-04.png,"the heavier threads are used for bedspreads ,"
e01-102-05.png,"chairbacks , luncheon mats , etc. Crochet hooks"
e01-102-06.png,"are made of steel , composition or bone . Steel"
e01-102-07.png,"crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0 ,"
e01-102-08.png,"the largest , to number 8 , the smallest ."
e01-107-00.png,Each size of hook is made for use with a certain
e01-107-01.png,"size of thread . To ensure the correct results ,"
e01-107-02.png,it is important that you use the size of hook
e01-107-03.png,specified in the directions . These are the
e01-107-04.png,correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet :
e01-107-05.png,Directions are given for a small practice
e01-107-06.png,piece for each stitch that you learn . When
e01-107-07.png,you have become proficient in these
e01-107-08.png,"stitches , attractive articles can be made"
e01-107-09.png,from the directions included in this book .
e01-113-00.png,1 . Grasp thread near end between thumb
e01-113-01.png,and forefinger . 2 . Make a loop by
e01-113-02.png,lapping long thread over short thread .
e01-113-03.png,3 . Hold loop in place between thumb
e01-113-04.png,and forefinger ( Fig. 1 ) . 1 . Take hold
e01-113-05.png,of broad bar of hook as you would a
e01-113-06.png,pencil . Bring middle finger forward to
e01-113-07.png,rest near tip of hook .
e01-119-00.png,2 . Insert hook through loop and under long
e01-119-01.png,thread . Catch long end of thread ( Fig. 2 ) .
e01-119-02.png,Draw loop through . 3 . Do not remove hook
e01-119-03.png,from thread . Pull short end and ball thread
e01-119-04.png,in opposite directions to bring loop close around
e01-119-05.png,"the end of the hook , but not too tight"
e01-119-06.png,"( Fig. 3 ) . Loop thread round little finger ,"
e01-119-07.png,across palm and behind forefinger ( Fig. 4 ) .
e02-000-00.png,A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
e02-000-01.png,"legs , and in reproduction period pieces they"
e02-000-02.png,are frequently used . The simpler varieties are
e02-000-03.png,"extremely easy to work , the four sides being"
e02-000-04.png,simply planed to give the required taper . In
e02-000-05.png,"the more elaborate varieties , however , a toe is"
e02-000-06.png,"worked in the solid , and this certainly"
e02-000-07.png,complicates the operation .
e02-014-00.png,For short ones a smoothing plane can be used .
e02-014-01.png,The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
e02-014-02.png,"on the newly planed surfaces , and these treated"
e02-014-03.png,as before . It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
e02-014-04.png,the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth
e02-014-05.png,of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
e02-014-06.png,straight .
e02-018-00.png,A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
e02-018-01.png,end reveals when the required amount
e02-018-02.png,"has been removed , and if care is taken"
e02-018-03.png,to stop the plane short of the squared
e02-018-04.png,"pencil line at the top , the work will be"
e02-018-05.png,accurate . The straight-edge can be used
e02-018-06.png,to test the straightness of the sides .
e02-021-00.png,"Incidentally , it is better to"
e02-021-01.png,complete any mortising that may be
e02-021-02.png,needed at the top before the tapering is
e02-021-03.png,begun . Some plain tapered legs have
e02-021-04.png,"the taper on the two inner faces only ,"
e02-021-05.png,the outer surfaces being vertical as
e02-021-06.png,"at ( B ) , Fig. 1 . To make a leg such as"
e02-021-07.png,"that at ( D ) , Fig. 1 , the square is first"
e02-021-08.png,"marked out as at ( A ) , Fig. 3 ."
e02-025-00.png,Note that squared lines marking
e02-025-01.png,the top member of the toe are
e02-025-02.png,needed as well as the upper ex-
e02-025-03.png,"tent of the taper , and in"
e02-025-04.png,this case it is necessary to
e02-025-05.png,mark in the line of the taper
e02-025-06.png,with pencil and straight-edge
e02-025-07.png,"as at ( B ) , Fig. 3 . A saw cut is"
e02-025-08.png,made at the upper toe line
e02-025-09.png,"exactly down to the taper line ,"
e02-025-10.png,no farther .
e02-074-00.png,"But why woodwork in particular ? Well , there"
e02-074-01.png,are many reasons . Wood is in good and
e02-074-02.png,common supply ; it lends itself to making
e02-074-03.png,innumerable useful household items -
e02-074-04.png,"furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ;"
e02-074-05.png,it enables results to be obtained fairly
e02-074-06.png,quickly ; it is less expensive than most
e02-074-07.png,other materials ; it is a pleasant material
e02-074-08.png,"to work with ; and , although it does"
e02-074-09.png,"create a certain amount of mess , it is"
e02-074-10.png,all clean and easily cleared away .
e02-082-00.png,This last point is certainly important because almost
e02-082-01.png,everyone has come to recognise that machines
e02-082-02.png,"are not only an economic necessity , but that a"
e02-082-03.png,great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
e02-082-04.png,installation of a power tool . As an elementary
e02-082-05.png,"example , surely no one can pretend to enjoy"
e02-082-06.png,ripping out parts from hardwood . Most men
e02-082-07.png,would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
e02-082-08.png,were available .
e02-086-00.png,"Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin"
e02-086-01.png,with what we have called a bare minimum kit . Probably
e02-086-02.png,most men have some of the tools already . It will enable
e02-086-03.png,"a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in"
e02-086-04.png,any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
e02-086-05.png,which other tools can be added as the need arises . The
e02-086-06.png,nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
e02-086-07.png,"to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit"
e02-086-08.png,which increases the range of things that can be
e02-086-09.png,made enormously .
e02-091-00.png,"As a still further development , we follow"
e02-091-01.png,"with a good basic kit , which includes"
e02-091-02.png,"the fuller kit ( which in its turn , of course ,"
e02-091-03.png,includes the bare minimum kit ) .
e02-091-04.png,With this the vast majority of jobs
e02-091-05.png,"can be done , though for advanced"
e02-091-06.png,cabinet work the necessity for
e02-091-07.png,certain special tools will become
e02-091-08.png,obvious .
e02-094-00.png,"Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and"
e02-094-01.png,"machines , the choice of which will"
e02-094-02.png,depend partly upon the space available
e02-094-03.png,"in the workshop , the amount one"
e02-094-04.png,"is prepared to pay , and the type of"
e02-094-05.png,"work a man normally does . First ,"
e02-094-06.png,"however , a word of advice generally ."
e02-094-07.png,Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
e02-094-08.png,machines . They never are cheap in the
e02-094-09.png,"long run . They may be inaccurate ,"
e02-100-00.png,"Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults"
e02-100-01.png,in design or quality soon become apparent . It is far
e02-100-02.png,better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
e02-100-03.png,"quality , and not handicap yourself from the start ."
e02-100-04.png,"To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow"
e02-100-05.png,yourself to blame the tools when the job does
e02-100-06.png,not turn out quite right !
e02-117-00.png,Many men with only limited accommodation
e02-117-01.png,have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table .
e02-117-02.png,"Providing this is sound , some perfectly good"
e02-117-03.png,"work can be done on it , but the usual problems"
e02-117-04.png,"are those of the vice , the bench stop , and storage"
e02-117-05.png,place for tools . The combined bench top and
e02-117-06.png,tool cupboard shown here has been specially
e02-117-07.png,designed and made for WOODWORKER
e02-117-08.png,readers who have this difficulty .
e04-000-00.png,HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the
e04-000-01.png,family man or father-to-be . Unlike many
e04-000-02.png,"commercial articles , this chair is solidly built and"
e04-000-03.png,capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
e04-000-04.png,most destructive youngster . Almost any available
e04-000-05.png,timber can be used but Parana pine is
e04-000-06.png,"recommended , being cheap , easy to work , and"
e04-000-07.png,taking a good finish .
e04-004-00.png,Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
e04-004-01.png,timber as shown in Fig. 1 . Although the timber will have already
e04-004-02.png,"been machine planed , remember to go over each piece with"
e04-004-03.png,"a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters"
e04-004-04.png,will show up after painting . The dimensions given enable the
e04-004-05.png,"feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table , but the height"
e04-004-06.png,can be altered if required .
e04-008-00.png,"All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned ,"
e04-008-01.png,which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat
e04-008-02.png,appearance . The side frames are joined by four cross pieces
e04-008-03.png,"each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses ( C ) ,"
e04-008-04.png,cut to fit them .
e04-011-00.png,See Fig. 2 . These are then glued and
e04-011-01.png,pinned into place . A similar piece of 1 in.
e04-011-02.png,by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across
e04-011-03.png,the end of the feeding tray as seen in
e04-011-04.png,Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of
e04-011-05.png,hardboard is covered with plastic material
e04-011-06.png,for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath
e04-011-07.png,the frame with panel pins to complete
e04-011-08.png,the feeding tray .
e04-015-00.png,Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
e04-015-01.png,fits up against the front legs of the
e04-015-02.png,chair . The seat rests across the upper two
e04-015-03.png,cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood
e04-015-04.png,"glued and panel pinned in position , measurements"
e04-015-05.png,being taken directly from the work . Fig. 4
e04-015-06.png,shows the framework for the back which
e04-015-07.png,is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber .
e04-019-00.png,The amount of the backward tilt and
e04-019-01.png,also the height is left to personal choice
e04-019-02.png,and the width is best taken directly
e04-019-03.png,from the work to ensure a good fit .
e04-019-04.png,Fix the piece A to the sides first
e04-019-05.png,with glue and panel pins and then fit
e04-019-06.png,the frame together with the piece
e04-019-07.png,B temporarily in place on the chair
e04-019-08.png,frame .
e04-022-00.png,"Decide on the required angle of slope ,"
e04-022-01.png,"keeping B flat on the chair seat , and mark"
e04-022-02.png,off the exact position of B on the side
e04-022-03.png,pieces . These can then be cut at the correct
e04-022-04.png,angle and B is glued and nailed in place .
e04-022-05.png,A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned
e04-022-06.png,to the frame and its edges planed off
e04-022-07.png,flush .
e04-026-00.png,Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with
e04-026-01.png,screws driven from the inside . The footrest is a
e04-026-02.png,piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in.
e04-026-03.png,by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair
e04-026-04.png,of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5 . When determining
e04-026-05.png,"the position of the footrest , do not place too near"
e04-026-06.png,the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs .
e04-030-00.png,"To complete the job , screw two fittings to the"
e04-030-01.png,inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
e04-030-02.png,back to hold the baby's safety harness . These can be
e04-030-03.png,made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
e04-030-04.png,wire as shown in Fig. 6 . Make sure that these
e04-030-05.png,are well secured as they will have to withstand
e04-030-06.png,considerable pulling as the child becomes older .
e04-034-00.png,Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes
e04-034-01.png,with plastic wood . Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
e04-034-02.png,framework and round off any sharp edges ( such as the
e04-034-03.png,"edge of the seat , feeding tray , etc ) . Fill the grain with a"
e04-034-04.png,woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
e04-034-05.png,"a suitable pastel shade , using a contrasting colour"
e04-034-06.png,for the seat and the back which can be decorated with
e04-034-07.png,a suitable nursery transfer .
e04-038-00.png,Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
e04-038-01.png,"if junior decides to bite the chair . Finally , it is as well"
e04-038-02.png,to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
e04-038-03.png,material that might be available as otherwise the
e04-038-04.png,paint would soon be scratched off .
e04-038-05.png,( J.H.P. ) BUILDING your own boat is a most
e04-038-06.png,satisfying and worthwhile project .
e04-043-00.png,Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
e04-043-01.png,rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
e04-043-02.png,sold . It is especially designed for simplicity in
e04-043-03.png,"construction , cheapness and lightness of weight ,"
e04-043-04.png,and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
e04-043-05.png,weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
e04-043-06.png,and an outboard motor with a comfortable
e04-043-07.png,margin of freeboard .
e04-052-00.png,"For instance , in Canada we use galvanised nails"
e04-052-01.png,in place of screws . We just bend them over and clamp
e04-052-02.png,firmly by using a hammer on each side . Over here I 've
e04-052-03.png,"always used brass screws , which are more expensive . The first"
e04-052-04.png,"job is to make your moulds . In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply ,"
e04-052-05.png,"but to save money any scrap may be used , and if this"
e04-052-06.png,"is nailed and glued together strongly , it may be marked"
e04-052-07.png,and cut to shape later .
e04-058-00.png,If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
e04-058-01.png,"the moulds , make a frame of rough lumber as shown in"
e04-058-02.png,Fig. 2 . The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
e04-058-03.png,"rigid as possible , for it is on these you will be building"
e04-058-04.png,"and shaping your little craft , upside-down . For cheapness"
e04-058-05.png,I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
e04-058-06.png,Columbia .
e04-062-00.png,This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
e04-062-01.png,a permanently water proof glue line . Be sure to
e04-062-02.png,"see that the edge bears the mark , P.M.B.C. Exterior ."
e04-062-03.png,This may be bought at any good timber merchants .
e04-062-04.png,The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
e04-062-05.png,"wood of the same make , or oak or mahogany . For the"
e04-062-06.png,"last one I made , I used the two flaps from an old"
e04-062-07.png,mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one
e04-062-08.png,shilling .
e04-068-00.png,I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
e04-068-01.png,"rowing this dinghy ( Fig. 3 ) . They are very simple , cheap"
e04-068-02.png,and easy to make . As will be seen from the plan
e04-068-03.png,there is only a single gunwale on the outside .
e04-068-04.png,I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
e04-068-05.png,is difficult to obtain here and expensive . I overcome
e04-068-06.png,this in another way as shown in Fig. 4 .
e04-079-00.png,Cut the moulds and the
e04-079-01.png,transoms to shape as in the
e04-079-02.png,detailed drawings . If you have
e04-079-03.png,a wooden floor you can use
e04-079-04.png,' A ' frames fastened to the floor
e04-079-05.png,"if not , use a strong horizontal"
e04-079-06.png,frame that will sit firmly on
e04-079-07.png,the ground or concrete floor . I
e04-079-08.png,use a heavy old base as in
e04-079-09.png,Fig. 2 .
e04-083-00.png,The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
e04-083-01.png,correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat .
e04-083-02.png,Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
e04-083-03.png,to allow for the chines to rest in these
e04-083-04.png,"notches , as they are not fastened to the"
e04-083-05.png,"moulds , which will only be used whilst"
e04-083-06.png,the hull is under construction .
e04-086-00.png,The chine is the long stringer on each side which
e04-086-01.png,is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves
e04-086-02.png,"cut in the moulds . Each chine is made of oak ,"
e04-086-03.png,"ash , spruce or any long grained flexible wood . I"
e04-086-04.png,prefer spruce when available . As will be seen
e04-086-05.png,"in the plan , the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in."
e04-086-06.png,on each side .
e04-091-00.png,The chines are morticed into this and butt up
e04-091-01.png,against the transom . Start at the bow and
e04-091-02.png,spring them both at the same time over the
e04-091-03.png,slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
e04-091-04.png,cut for this purpose in the stern or after
e04-091-05.png,"transom framing . Glue , screw and make fast ."
e04-095-00.png,"The skeleton of the boat will now take shape ,"
e04-095-01.png,and this is the time to check before making fast
e04-095-02.png,to see that nothing is distorted . Ensure that
e04-095-03.png,the outside measurements from transom to transom
e04-095-04.png,are equal on each side and that the transoms
e04-095-05.png,are parallel horizontally . Next bevel the chines
e04-095-06.png,with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly .
e04-099-00.png,Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
e04-099-01.png,plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
e04-099-02.png,planing after fixing to the boat . Use your two
e04-099-03.png,lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
e04-099-04.png,"purpose , the sides from one , and the bottom from"
e04-099-05.png,the other . If care is taken not to waste the
e04-099-06.png,"ply , plenty of material is left over for the thwarts ."
e04-103-00.png,"Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready"
e04-103-01.png,"to plank the sides . Start again at the bows ,"
e04-103-02.png,clamping into position with a ' D ' clamp . Bend
e04-103-03.png,round the frame to the stern and clamp there . If
e04-103-04.png,you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
e04-103-05.png,"well . After generously covering with glue , screw"
e04-103-06.png,the sides to the transom framing and the chine .
e04-109-00.png,Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail
e04-109-01.png,"with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if"
e04-109-02.png,you are doing it that way . Use flat head screws
e04-109-03.png,about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in
e04-109-04.png,the 1/4 in. ply . Make a very small hole for
e04-109-05.png,the screw to allow for a good grip . Remember
e04-109-06.png,to glue before screwing .
e04-114-00.png,"Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom ,"
e04-114-01.png,which is cut in one piece . It should overlap just a
e04-114-02.png,trifle ; this can be cleaned up later . As you are
e04-114-03.png,screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
e04-114-04.png,necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
e04-114-05.png,the screws . I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
e04-114-06.png,"the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and"
e04-114-07.png,the bottom shaped transom facing .
e04-119-00.png,"Again , don't forget to glue . Now put on the keel and"
e04-119-01.png,the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off
e04-119-02.png,"the moulds . You won't want them again for this boat , so"
e04-119-03.png,shift them right out of the way . Place the boat right side
e04-119-04.png,up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for
e04-119-05.png,working .
e04-124-00.png,Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts ( seats )
e04-124-01.png,taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats
e04-124-02.png,with vertical members as shown in the plans . Make the
e04-124-03.png,four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions
e04-124-04.png,before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
e04-124-05.png,a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside ( gunwale )
e04-124-06.png,one to fit the block .
e04-127-00.png,I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
e04-127-01.png,with copper nails and roves . It greatly improves the
e04-127-02.png,"appearance and the strength . Paint with good marine primer ,"
e04-127-03.png,undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint .
e04-127-04.png,WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
e04-127-05.png,into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either
e04-127-06.png,making fabric pictures or designs .
e04-132-00.png,While these may ultimately be made into a picture
e04-132-01.png,"for framing and hanging on a wall , they may"
e04-132-02.png,"also be arranged into a design , and the"
e04-132-03.png,resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful
e04-132-04.png,article .
e06-000-00.png,This could hardly happen without the
e06-000-01.png,herring having some orientation with the
e06-000-02.png,sea bottom . It means that the crowding
e06-000-03.png,"is caused during the daytime , and that"
e06-000-04.png,the herring must continue to migrate over
e06-000-05.png,the ground as well as in midwater and
e06-000-06.png,during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
e06-000-07.png,is always from the north ) .
e06-003-00.png,Thus we can see that herring
e06-003-01.png,"movements , although primarily"
e06-003-02.png,"instinctive perhaps , and certainly"
e06-003-03.png,"helped and hindered by water flow ,"
e06-003-04.png,are also closely related to the sea-bed
e06-003-05.png,"geography . Geography , too , names the"
e06-003-06.png,great fisheries that depend on them :
e06-003-07.png,the Fladen Ground ( where again most big
e06-003-08.png,"shots are taken on the edges ) , the Gut ,"
e06-003-09.png,a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
e06-003-10.png,the herring spawn along the northern
e06-006-00.png,The effect of bottom congestion due to
e06-006-01.png,the light pressure is inevitably mixed
e06-006-02.png,with that of the suitability of ground
e06-006-03.png,"for spawning . Both result in crowding ,"
e06-006-04.png,so there is no need to try to separate
e06-006-05.png,them - thank Heaven ! A good picture of
e06-006-06.png,this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
e06-006-07.png,grounds from the Viking in the north down
e06-006-08.png,to the Klondykes and the Reef along
e06-006-09.png,the western edge of the Norwegian
e06-006-10.png,Deep .
e06-010-00.png,In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
e06-010-01.png,Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure . But
e06-010-02.png,"they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until"
e06-010-03.png,in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
e06-010-04.png,echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
e06-010-05.png,their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
e06-010-06.png,gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
e06-010-07.png,spawning herring are always found .
e06-015-00.png,The joint evidence of echo-sounders
e06-015-01.png,and fishing gear leads to an overall
e06-015-02.png,though somewhat dim picture .
e06-015-03.png,The details are harder still to see .
e06-015-04.png,"Drift Effects . At East Anglia , for instance ,"
e06-015-05.png,shoals that gather at the Knoll or
e06-015-06.png,other banks are most of them
e06-015-07.png,going to travel a hundred
e06-015-08.png,miles farther south before they
e06-015-09.png,spawn . Some will spawn at the
e06-021-00.png,So the arrival of any particular shoal
e06-021-01.png,fish at a certain spawning ground may
e06-021-02.png,be accidental . Yet there will always be some
e06-021-03.png,"that find it if enough are travelling , just as"
e06-021-04.png,the robin who gets back exactly may be
e06-021-05.png,only one among thousands who do not .
e06-021-06.png,But this southerly migration is not
e06-021-07.png,accidental . Being contranatant or against
e06-021-08.png,"the drift , it probably has a survival value"
e06-021-09.png,in ensuring that the fry after hatching
e06-021-10.png,are drifted back into the normal home
e06-026-00.png,Drift in another form probably
e06-026-01.png,explains how these migrating herring
e06-026-02.png,are biased to east or west by the
e06-026-03.png,different winds . Strong westerlies
e06-026-04.png,are well known to bring good
e06-026-05.png,longshore fishings . The surface
e06-026-06.png,water that is blown offshore must
e06-026-07.png,be replaced by an underflow bringing
e06-026-08.png,with it the herring to the Norfolk
e06-026-09.png,and Suffolk beaches .
e06-030-00.png,"Easterly winds , on the other hand ,"
e06-030-01.png,"mean no herring along the shore , as"
e06-030-02.png,recent years have shown . A succession
e06-030-03.png,of winds is needed for this effect of
e06-030-04.png,"course - one breeze will not do it ,"
e06-030-05.png,though a very hard westerly will
e06-030-06.png,"often start off the "" local "" herring ;"
e06-030-07.png,but quite apart from this wind effect
e06-030-08.png,there is an easterly drift special
e06-030-09.png,"to this rump of coastline , caused by"
e06-030-10.png,the meeting of water from north and south .
e06-033-00.png,"Herring fishermen call this "" the outset "" . It"
e06-033-01.png,"is strongest at spring tides , when without"
e06-033-02.png,"wind you will "" set "" out - or drift to the east-"
e06-033-03.png,"ward , the length of half a fleet of nets -"
e06-033-04.png,almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
e06-033-05.png,Knoll . Without an explanation of how it
e06-033-06.png,"works , it may well be that this outset , akin"
e06-033-07.png,"to the mouth of a great salmon river , has"
e06-033-08.png,been the biggest factor through the ages
e06-033-09.png,in the constancy of this great herring fishery .
e06-037-00.png,The East Anglian behaviour ( see p. 82 )
e06-037-01.png,has always differed from that of the
e06-037-02.png,"summer fisheries . There is the "" swim """
e06-037-03.png,"at slack waters , even in daylight"
e06-037-04.png,"sometimes ; and the high swimming ,"
e06-037-05.png,when fish are caught only in the top
e06-037-06.png,few yards of netting . These and other
e06-037-07.png,fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
e06-037-08.png,"to this fishery , which unfortunately seems"
e06-037-09.png,to be dying out ; but a full discussion of
e06-037-10.png,them is beyond the present scope .
e06-041-00.png,The Bow-wave Theory . This assumes
e06-041-01.png,"that all fishing gear , when moving ,"
e06-041-02.png,"sends before it a kind of scaring effect ,"
e06-041-03.png,probably through waves or vibrations in
e06-041-04.png,the water or along the ground .
e06-041-05.png,Underwater films suggest that the
e06-041-06.png,footrope of a trawl does this . Films
e06-041-07.png,have also shown plaice moving before
e06-041-08.png,a seine net in just the same way after
e06-041-09.png,being gathered inwards by the ropes .
e06-046-00.png,( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved ; it may
e06-046-01.png,"be by actual contact , or by sight reaction to the disturbed"
e06-046-02.png,"sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations"
e06-046-03.png,through or along the bottom . ) But given such a bow
e06-046-04.png,"wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something"
e06-046-05.png,"to overcome its effect , very few fish would be caught ."
e06-049-00.png,Let us consider first what would
e06-049-01.png,appear to be the simplest case -
e06-049-02.png,that of flat fish on the bottom .
e06-049-03.png,The evidence suggest that the fish are
e06-049-04.png,aware of the moving footrope before
e06-049-05.png,it reaches them . They move away before
e06-049-06.png,"it , swimming at the same speed"
e06-049-07.png,"for an unknown period of time , until"
e06-049-08.png,"they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used"
e06-049-09.png,to the disturbance .
e06-053-00.png,Then they stop swimming and are caught . In
e06-053-01.png,the seine-net film this usually seemed to
e06-053-02.png,happen just after the fish had risen above
e06-053-03.png,"the footrope , and presumably out of its"
e06-053-04.png,"field of disturbance , or bow wave . This suggests"
e06-053-05.png,that the wave might be transmitted by the
e06-053-06.png,"sea-bed , though the footrope in this case"
e06-053-07.png,was actually just off the bottom and was
e06-053-08.png,indeed passing over some fish .
e06-070-00.png,Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
e06-070-01.png,And in this film the rise of the fish was
e06-070-02.png,"small , a matter of a foot or two . With round"
e06-070-03.png,"fish like haddock , which would hardly"
e06-070-04.png,"find safety on the bottom , this cover"
e06-070-05.png,would seem to be even more essential ;
e06-070-06.png,but more films are needed to prove this .
e06-070-07.png,Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
e06-070-08.png,essential to catch round fish whose
e06-070-09.png,reaction to disturbance would be upwards .
e07-000-00.png,WE have not yet reached the stage in Britain
e07-000-01.png,"when 50 planes are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons"
e07-000-02.png,of DDT and fuel oil over 3 million acres or when
e07-000-03.png,20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin . An eye-
e07-000-04.png,witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with
e07-000-05.png,the stench of small game and birds dead from insecti-

e07-003-01.png,does the balance of nature by killing both pests
e07-003-02.png,"and predators , is viewed with concern by a"
e07-003-03.png,number of American State Research Stations . Not
e07-003-04.png,content with issuing bulletins on the dangers
e07-003-05.png,"of the misuse of chemicals in agriculture ,"
e07-003-06.png,some stations are carrying out useful research on
e07-003-07.png,pest control by biological means . Both native and
e07-003-08.png,imported predatory insects and insect pathogens
e07-003-09.png,are used in field trial tests .
e07-007-00.png,The biological control of pests in the garden
e07-007-01.png,is not new to the American gardener . Lady-
e07-007-02.png,"birds figure in press advertisements , their"
e07-007-03.png,sale being by the gallon . Praying mantis ( Mantis
e07-007-04.png,"religiosa ) , both native and "" immigrant "" varieties ,"
e07-007-05.png,are used by gardeners in all parts of the United
e07-007-06.png,"States . Advertisements offer eggs of European ,"
e07-007-07.png,Chinese or native forms of mantis .
e07-012-00.png,From the day it hatches in the spring
e07-012-01.png,"until it dies in the late autumn , the"
e07-012-02.png,praying mantis satisfies its voracity by
e07-012-03.png,eating other insects . Nine blowflies
e07-012-04.png,may be consumed at one sitting and
e07-012-05.png,"the fully adult , 2 1/2-in.-long insect ,"
e07-012-06.png,is able to keep a firm hold on one
e07-012-07.png,grasshopper while eating another .
e07-012-08.png,"According to Dr. Max Beier in "" Fang-"
e07-012-09.png,"heuschrecken "" ( Die Neue Brehm Bu""ckerei ,"
e07-012-10.png,"1952 ) , the praying mantis is trecking"
e07-012-11.png,northwards .
e07-061-00.png,Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an
e07-061-01.png,egg-case of the Chinese mantis . The
e07-061-02.png,first mantis had hatched from the very large
e07-061-03.png,egg-case on June 6 . Both the Chinese
e07-061-04.png,"and Spanish mantis , in the young stage"
e07-061-05.png,"at any rate , are light brown in colour ."
e07-061-06.png,"Because of the cool , wet weather , I had great"
e07-061-07.png,"difficulty in breeding fruit flies and , after"
e07-061-08.png,many of the mantis of both types had died
e07-061-09.png,"in my Kilner jars , I poured living mantis"
e07-061-10.png,over vines and peachtrees .
e07-066-00.png,A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in
e07-066-01.png,"Grantham , Lincs , kindly offered to"
e07-066-02.png,cooperate with me in studying praying
e07-066-03.png,mantis as a pest control in the cold
e07-066-04.png,greenhouse . Of the dozen Spanish mantis
e07-066-05.png,"sent him by post on June 22 , only two or"
e07-066-06.png,three survived the journey ; one thrived
e07-066-07.png,and the latest report I have is that
e07-066-08.png,this mantis is still alive .
e07-072-00.png,DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes
e07-072-01.png,"since the end of the war , clay pots are"
e07-072-02.png,still in greatest demand . It is mostly
e07-072-03.png,in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
e07-072-04.png,"have made headway , and although"
e07-072-05.png,numerous small clay pots are used each
e07-072-06.png,"year , they are fewer than they were 10"
e07-072-07.png,years ago . In the larger sizes there is still
e07-072-08.png,no real substitute for clay that can be
e07-072-09.png,"obtained at a comparable price , except the"
e07-072-10.png,bituminized paper pots which are used on
e07-072-11.png,commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
e07-076-00.png,The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
e07-076-01.png,brittle nature ; even with reasonably careful
e07-076-02.png,"handling , the annual losses are often around"
e07-076-03.png,"10 per cent. , and where the handling and"
e07-076-04.png,"storage facilities are not too good , these"
e07-076-05.png,losses will be even greater . This does not
e07-076-06.png,"necessarily apply to the larger sizes , as"
e07-076-07.png,they are not quite so fragile as the
e07-076-08.png,smaller ones and are not normally thrown
e07-076-09.png,about in quite the same way .
e07-079-00.png,The storage problem puts clay pots at a
e07-079-01.png,definite disadvantage . They are fairly heavy
e07-079-02.png,and difficult things to accommodate and
e07-079-03.png,they must have some protection from severe
e07-079-04.png,"weather , which can be quite a headache in"
e07-079-05.png,a small garden . While admitting that
e07-079-06.png,broken pots have on occasions provided
e07-079-07.png,"artists with delightful studies , there is no"
e07-079-08.png,"doubt that a pile of badly stacked ,"
e07-079-09.png,half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
e07-079-10.png,from any point of view .
e07-083-00.png,Every garden boy will agree that having to
e07-083-01.png,wash clay pots is a definite factor in
e07-083-02.png,favour of their abolition ; in fact one
e07-083-03.png,young man was so wholehearted about this
e07-083-04.png,a few years ago that he made the headlines
e07-083-05.png,for having smashed a large number # to
e07-083-06.png,relieve his feelings . On the small-to-medium
e07-083-07.png,"establishment , it is a disagreeable chore"
e07-083-08.png,"which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm ,"
e07-083-09.png,whereas on larger establishments the pots
e07-083-10.png,can be sterilized or washed by machine .
e07-086-00.png,It is not easy to make an economic
e07-086-01.png,comparison between clay pots and the various
e07-086-02.png,substitutes ; the former may last indefinitely
e07-086-03.png,"with luck , while the latter are often"
e07-086-04.png,expendable used only once . Clay pots are
e07-086-05.png,efficient and congenial containers in which
e07-086-06.png,to grow plants . In their proper setting they
e07-086-07.png,"are not unattractive and , in spite of"
e07-086-08.png,"their shortcomings , most gardeners have"
e07-086-09.png,a nostalgic affection for them .
e07-090-00.png,"Present-day pots are better finished , do"
e07-090-01.png,not get dirty so readily and are easier to
e07-090-02.png,wash . The deep rims make for neater and
e07-090-03.png,"safer stacking , though they are still"
e07-090-04.png,expensive and still get broken . On the
e07-090-05.png,"other hand , there is really no replacement"
e07-090-06.png,"for the larger sizes , so they have the"
e07-090-07.png,decided advantage of being the only
e07-090-08.png,suitable container available in quantity
e07-090-09.png,for fairly large plants .
e07-094-00.png,Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
e07-094-01.png,pots for plant raising . These are compressed blocks of
e07-094-02.png,"compost , made in a specially devised press to"
e07-094-03.png,simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot .
e07-094-04.png,"Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape , they"
e07-094-05.png,are made of the same compost as would have
e07-094-06.png,"been used in a pot , the # only difference being"
e07-094-07.png,that it is used in a slightly moister
e07-094-08.png,condition .
e07-098-00.png,"Seed is sown , or seedlings are pricked out into them"
e07-098-01.png,"in the normal way , the only real difference"
e07-098-02.png,being that more of the watering is done through a
e07-098-03.png,rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
e07-098-04.png,"of water . First-class plants of tomatoes ,"
e07-098-05.png,"cucumbers , marrows , melons , cauliflowers ,"
e07-098-06.png,"celery and onions , may all be raised in soil"
e07-098-07.png,blocks ; so can such flowering plants as
e07-098-08.png,"dahlias , chrysanthemums , salvias , sweet peas ,"
e07-098-09.png,lupins and numerous others .
e07-101-00.png,One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
e07-101-01.png,one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved
e07-101-02.png,completely . Manufacturing the block and planting
e07-101-03.png,"it is very little more trouble than normal potting ,"
e07-101-04.png,"and a superior plant , which transplants more"
e07-101-05.png,"easily , is produced . The obvious limitation #"
e07-101-06.png,is that soil blocks can only be used for
e07-101-07.png,propagating ; there can be no progression to a
e07-101-08.png,larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
e07-101-09.png,to be moved ; it must be planted out or
e07-101-10.png,potted .
e07-105-00.png,Many amateur gardeners might improve their
e07-105-01.png,results by buying a small hand-operated soil
e07-105-02.png,block maker and use the money saved on
e07-105-03.png,buying small pots to improve their composts .
e07-105-04.png,The various types of small paper pots are very
e07-105-05.png,"useful for short-term operations , but are"
e07-105-06.png,inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
e07-105-07.png,too long .
e07-108-00.png,They are # quite useful for plants that are
e07-108-01.png,"despatched to market or direct to customers ,"
e07-108-02.png,their cheapness making them attractive to the
e07-108-03.png,nurseryman ; there is also considerable saving
e07-108-04.png,in carriage costs because of their lightness .
e07-108-05.png,There are many types of plastic pots available ;
e07-108-06.png,"some expensive , some quite cheap ; some good"
e07-108-07.png,and others not so good . A wide range of
e07-108-08.png,plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
e07-108-09.png,usually need less water than those in clay
e07-108-10.png,pots .
e07-112-00.png,They are slightly more difficult to
e07-112-01.png,"manage , however , until a little experience"
e07-112-02.png,has been gained with them . Plastic pots
e07-112-03.png,"are usually more expensive than clay ones ,"
e07-112-04.png,but they are almost indestructible and
e07-112-05.png,will last a long time with normal care .
f01-053-00.png,The job of the teacher is to set the learner's
f01-053-01.png,vocabulary to work on the existing store
f01-053-02.png,so as to make it grow . He does not
f01-053-03.png,simply pack new things into the store .
f01-053-04.png,The solitary learner has to find out
f01-053-05.png,"how to do this for himself , with the help"
f01-053-06.png,of books . He uses his vocabulary to
f01-053-07.png,ask questions and uses the books to
f01-053-08.png,find the answers .
f01-058-00.png,Thus learning how to learn means becoming
f01-058-01.png,"your own philosopher , your own psychologist"
f01-058-02.png,and your own teacher . You will then be
f01-058-03.png,a well-established learner and the world
f01-058-04.png,will be at your feet . Although the word
f01-058-05.png,""" mind "" has given rise to endless"
f01-058-06.png,controversy among philosophers and psycho-
f01-058-07.png,"logists , many of whom would like to"
f01-058-08.png,"abolish it from the dictionary , most"
f01-058-09.png,of us obstinately go on using it .
f01-066-00.png,And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
f01-066-01.png,""" mind "" vanishes , at any rate for some time . It seems very difficult"
f01-066-02.png,"to detach the mind from the brain , and all the biological ,"
f01-066-03.png,surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
f01-066-04.png,close connection . There is a lot to be said for keeping the
f01-066-05.png,"word "" soul "" to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable"
f01-066-06.png,essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
f01-066-07.png,"the body , and to reserve the more prosaic word "" mind "" for"
f01-066-08.png,the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
f01-066-09.png,are clearly associated with the brain .
f01-070-00.png,Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
f01-070-01.png,"picture of this "" basis "" of mental phenomena ?"
f01-070-02.png,"The physicists have succeeded remarkably well ,"
f01-070-03.png,"with the atomic theory , in giving a clear and detailed"
f01-070-04.png,picture of the basis of such material phenomena
f01-070-05.png,"as chemical action , magnetism , the behaviour of"
f01-070-06.png,gases and so on . Where has psychology got to in its
f01-070-07.png,"theories of "" mind "" ? Are there any ultimate units"
f01-070-08.png,of mind akin to the atoms of matter ?
f01-075-00.png,At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
f01-075-01.png,be analysed into discrete bits . These bits were
f01-075-02.png,identified as elementary sensations . These were
f01-075-03.png,thought to combine together to form compound
f01-075-04.png,experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
f01-075-05.png,matter combine to form molecular compounds .
f01-075-06.png,But this view led to too many difficulties and
f01-075-07.png,was finally abandoned . Nevertheless the search
f01-075-08.png,for basic units of mind has gone on and will
f01-075-09.png,"doubtless continue , for it is the aim of science to"
f01-075-10.png,discover ultimate units .
f01-081-00.png,"We must beware , however , of supposing that there must be any"
f01-081-01.png,close analogy between the units of quite different
f01-081-02.png,sciences . For example the success of the atomic theory
f01-081-03.png,in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
f01-081-04.png,units of geometry must be points . It would be more
f01-081-05.png,correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
f01-081-06.png,geometry .
f01-085-00.png,There have been many conflicting tendencies in
f01-085-01.png,psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
f01-085-02.png,we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
f01-085-03.png,concept which is current today . It is known as the schema .
f01-085-04.png,It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
f01-085-05.png,concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
f01-085-06.png,but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction .
f01-135-00.png,It is the tendency to get things
f01-135-01.png,the wrong way round . As a
f01-135-02.png,psychologist I am constantly
f01-135-03.png,encountering this tendency
f01-135-04.png,in friends and acquaintances .
f01-135-05.png,They think there is something
f01-135-06.png,"inevitably "" queer "" about psychology"
f01-135-07.png,and this feeling of queerness
f01-135-08.png,usually boils down to a quite
f01-135-09.png,mistaken belief that the
f01-135-10.png,psychologist first looks into ...
f01-139-00.png,"This is what I mean by "" getting things the wrong way"
f01-139-01.png,"round "" . He is far more likely to find out about how"
f01-139-02.png,his own mind works by looking at other people's .
f01-139-03.png,"For although looking inwards ( or "" introspecting """
f01-139-04.png,"as it is called ) , is not entirely ruled out ,"
f01-139-05.png,nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
f01-139-06.png,one of the most unreliable methods of getting
f01-139-07.png,any precise information .
f01-143-00.png,And so they prefer objective methods . Since they cannot
f01-143-01.png,directly look into the mental processes of another
f01-143-02.png,person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
f01-143-03.png,to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
f01-143-04.png,this behaviour . This is no more queer than the method
f01-143-05.png,"of the doctor who observes signs , and records symptoms ,"
f01-143-06.png,and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them .
f01-147-00.png,He may never have had the disease himself but he
f01-147-01.png,can nevertheless identify it . Similarly the psychologist has
f01-147-02.png,to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
f01-147-03.png,"all kinds of processes in other people , whether or not they"
f01-147-04.png,correspond with anything in his own experience . We know
f01-147-05.png,very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
f01-147-06.png,"provide our schemas , nor do we need to know as far as"
f01-147-07.png,psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
f01-147-08.png,the neuro-physiologists .
f02-000-00.png,"The numerically largest group , consisting of male"
f02-000-01.png,weekly wage-earners up to chargehand level
f02-000-02.png,"and in the works only , excluding the offices , was"
f02-000-03.png,therefore selected . A detailed age-structure was
f02-000-04.png,"compiled from personnel department records ,"
f02-000-05.png,revealing that there were ( at that time ) seven-
f02-000-06.png,"teen men seventy years of age or older ,"
f02-000-07.png,"thirty-three aged sixty-four years , and sixty-"
f02-000-08.png,five just fifty years of age .
f02-003-00.png,"A small panel was formed , not on a formally representative"
f02-003-01.png,"basis but rather of energetic and concerned individuals ,"
f02-003-02.png,from various levels in the firm . In due course
f02-003-03.png,the panel decided to seek further insight into the
f02-003-04.png,"problems faced by older workers , and approached"
f02-003-05.png,those seventy years of age or older .
f02-017-00.png,"The Rubery , Owen scheme is now in its"
f02-017-01.png,"fourth year , and opportunity has been taken"
f02-017-02.png,to revise the course in the light of
f02-017-03.png,experience . Topics for the six weekly meetings
f02-017-04.png,of one-and-a-half hours ( each held half in
f02-017-05.png,"company time , half in the man's time ) are"
f02-017-06.png,now as follows : 1 . Personal adjustment 2 . Health
f02-017-07.png,3 . Work and leisure 4 . Living arrangements
f02-017-08.png,5 . Financial planning 6 . Final discussion
f02-020-00.png,"The weekend conference for the men and their wives ,"
f02-020-01.png,which takes place at company expense in a country or
f02-020-02.png,"resort hotel , includes an address on ' The Woman's Point"
f02-020-03.png,of View ' and one on ' Making the Most of Health ' . Separate
f02-020-04.png,discussions are arranged for the wives in addition to the
f02-020-05.png,plenary sessions . Of the men reaching fifty years of age
f02-020-06.png,"since the scheme started , 125 ( 37.2 per cent ) have"
f02-020-07.png,taken part .
f02-030-00.png,The original scheme was planned to provide short re-
f02-030-01.png,fresher courses at the ages of fifty-five and sixty :
f02-030-02.png,"the first of these is due in 1963 . Meanwhile , each"
f02-030-03.png,' graduate ' is encouraged to seek help and advice in
f02-030-04.png,"working out his ideas , either through the company's"
f02-030-05.png,personnel department or by an approach to
f02-030-06.png,members of the panel responsible for the scheme .
f02-033-00.png,The latter do not regard themselves as expert
f02-033-01.png,"advisers , but are prepared to seek out the"
f02-033-02.png,appropriate sources of information or advice .
f02-033-03.png,"Towards the end of 1956 , Mr. Daniel Grant ,"
f02-033-04.png,an Employee Relations Officer of
f02-033-05.png,Rolls-Royce Ltd. and a member of the
f02-033-06.png,"Workers' Educational Association , submitted"
f02-033-07.png,"to the Lord Provost of Glasgow , Dr. Andrew"
f02-033-08.png,"Hood , a copy of his report on an enquiry"
f02-033-09.png,he had made into the problems that beset
f02-033-10.png,older workers and the effects of retirement
f02-033-11.png,Hugentobler Roger
f02-036-00.png,"The Lord Provost , having studied the report on ' The Morale and"
f02-036-01.png,"Health of Retired Workers ' , and being satisfied that the matters"
f02-036-02.png,raised were of considerable importance to the citizens of
f02-036-03.png,"Glasgow and warranted further study , set an informal"
f02-036-04.png,committee representative of bodies particularly concerned with
f02-036-05.png,the welfare of older people to examine the report and
f02-036-06.png,its implications and to consider the advisability of
f02-036-07.png,arranging a Conference on Preparation for and
f02-036-08.png,Occupational Activities on Retirement .
f02-038-00.png,The large attendance and atmosphere of
f02-038-01.png,"this Conference , held in October , 1957 ,"
f02-038-02.png,reflected not only an increasing awareness
f02-038-03.png,of the problems of men and women nearing
f02-038-04.png,or already in retirement but also a strong
f02-038-05.png,desire on the part of all concerned for
f02-038-06.png,concerted action towards preparing men
f02-038-07.png,and women for life in retirement and more
f02-038-08.png,adequate provision of facilities for

f02-040-02.png,chairman and Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary . The
f02-040-03.png,Council has active committees on Education and
f02-040-04.png,"Preparation for Retirement , and on Occupational"
f02-040-05.png,Centres . The former consists of representatives from
f02-040-06.png,the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department ;
f02-040-07.png,the Workers' Educational Association ; the University
f02-040-08.png,Extra-Mural Education Committee and departments
f02-040-09.png,"of psychology , education and social science ; ... ."
f02-044-00.png,"In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks , Assistant Director"
f02-044-01.png,"of Education for Glasgow , that industrial firms might be ready"
f02-044-02.png,to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
f02-044-03.png,"for retirement , their wages paid for the time thus spent . An"
f02-044-04.png,approach was made to about twenty large firms and in Oc-
f02-044-05.png,"tober , 1959 , the first experimental day-release course for"
f02-044-06.png,men was organised . Eleven students from seven firms atten-
f02-044-07.png,ded a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both
f02-044-08.png,to the men and their employers that the venture was an
f02-044-09.png,experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
f02-044-10.png,as the participants .
f02-076-00.png,1 . Are there differences in adjustment to ageing
f02-076-01.png,and retirement according to the occupational
f02-076-02.png,"level of employees ? 2 . If so , which occupational"
f02-076-03.png,levels are the better or the poorer prepared
f02-076-04.png,for successful adjustment to retirement and
f02-076-05.png,in what aspects ? 3 . Does the evidence
f02-076-06.png,obtained support a rationale for adapting
f02-076-07.png,a pre-retirement planning and preparation
f02-076-08.png,programme to the needs of older employees
f02-076-09.png,of different occupational levels ?
f03-169-00.png,Each time you rehearse you will probably put
f03-169-01.png,things in a different way . All the better ! - it will
f03-169-02.png,sound much more spontaneous on the occasion
f03-169-03.png,itself . Remember your four names - have the list
f03-169-04.png,with you if you like - and you simply can't
f03-169-05.png,"be flummoxed ! Of course , in any speech a good"
f03-169-06.png,start and a good finish are half the battle .
f03-174-00.png,"So - see the next page ! Yes , they are waiting for you ."
f03-174-01.png,But there is no need to be frightened . The audience
f03-174-02.png,will eat out of your hand - if they like what
f03-174-03.png,you offer them . A good start will put them in a
f03-174-04.png,good humour . Ladies and gentlemen ! I 'm afraid
f03-174-05.png,I have not had much experience of public speaking .
f03-182-00.png,But that 's a terrible way to begin ! Why tell them you
f03-182-01.png,are a novice ? It 's their interest you want - not their
f03-182-02.png,sympathy . And you want to get it from the word
f03-182-03.png,GO ! Try something like this : It is said that tele-
f03-182-04.png,"vision keeps people at home . But you , at any"
f03-182-05.png,"rate , have proved that wrong . And they say , too ,"
f03-182-06.png,that television makes its appeal to those of lesser
f03-182-07.png,intelligence .
f03-191-00.png,May I suggest that you have proved that
f03-191-01.png,right ! Congratulations ! And away you go into
f03-191-02.png,"your speech . Take some thought , too , for your ending ."
f03-191-03.png,Thank you for listening to me so patiently . A political
f03-191-04.png,candidate often used that finish . No wonder he
f03-191-05.png,didn't get in ! Instead he might have ended
f03-191-06.png,"this way : Well , those are my views ."
f04-004-00.png,When he learned what was causing the commotion he
f04-004-01.png,"became greatly alarmed , and after the body had been"
f04-004-02.png,taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
f04-004-03.png,grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
f04-004-04.png,"Camp , aged thirty-three , the girl who was to have"
f04-004-05.png,been his bride . There was little doubt of how
f04-004-06.png,"she had met her death , and even less that it"
f04-004-07.png,had been murder .
f04-007-00.png,She had been struck several times with a blunt
f04-007-01.png,"instrument , and her head was smashed in ."
f04-007-02.png,"There were signs of a violent struggle , blood"
f04-007-03.png,"on the cushions and floor , and the remains"
f04-007-04.png,of her broken umbrella . But a pair of bone
f04-007-05.png,cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
f04-007-06.png,to provide the only possible clue to the killer .
f04-011-00.png,"The body was examined , and it was definitely"
f04-011-01.png,established that no sexual assault had taken place .
f04-011-02.png,It seemed probable that the motive had been
f04-011-03.png,"robbery , and this was further confirmed when a"
f04-011-04.png,check was made with the woman's relations in
f04-011-05.png,Hounslow . Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
f04-011-06.png,"Good Intent , a public-house in Walworth . Her day"
f04-011-07.png,"off was Thursday , and before coming up to London"
f04-011-08.png,"in the evening she had called on her two sisters ,"
f04-011-09.png,one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
f04-011-10.png,"other at Hounslow , where she kept a shop ."
f04-016-00.png,"Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon ,"
f04-016-01.png,"and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M. , where"
f04-016-02.png,"she had tea with her other sister , and then"
f04-016-03.png,went to catch the 7.42 . Her sister saw her
f04-016-04.png,"to the station , helping her with some of"
f04-016-05.png,her packages . This sister was able to establish
f04-016-06.png,that she had carried a green purse and
f04-016-07.png,had bought a railway ticket .
f04-020-00.png,"But both purse and ticket , and the packages , were gone when the body"
f04-020-01.png,was found at Waterloo . Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
f04-020-02.png,likely that she had been carrying much money . A porter at Hounslow
f04-020-03.png,supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
f04-020-04.png,"compartment when the train left , but this did not help much , since it"
f04-020-05.png,had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo .
f04-024-00.png,The police began a systematic search of the line -
f04-024-01.png,"no easy task , but one in which patience and method"
f04-024-02.png,paid off . At a spot on the embankment between
f04-024-03.png,Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
f04-024-04.png,"pestle such as chemists use , with some hairs"
f04-024-05.png,"sticking to it . The murder weapon , more than likely ,"
f04-024-06.png,and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
f04-024-07.png,killer to book in modern times .
f04-028-00.png,"But in 1897 , alas ! there was no fingerprint bureau ,"
f04-028-01.png,no experts to check and photograph any ' dabs ' it
f04-028-02.png,might have yielded . It was a tough case to
f04-028-03.png,"tackle , and Superintendent Robinson , of the L.S.W.R."
f04-028-04.png,"Police , and Chief Inspector Marshall , of Scotland"
f04-028-05.png,"Yard , combined forces in the investigation . While"
f04-028-06.png,accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
f04-028-07.png,"attacked for the sake of robbery , they did not"
f04-028-08.png,overlook the possibility that this might have
f04-028-09.png,"disguised another motive , and a thorough check"
f04-028-10.png,of her former men friends and acquaintances began .
f04-032-00.png,"They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours , so-"
f04-032-01.png,"me well meant , some mischievous , including one that a"
f04-032-02.png,man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
f04-032-03.png,"the Thursday evening , with blood actually dripping from"
f04-032-04.png,"his hands . The inquest was opened on February 17 , but ,"
f04-032-05.png,beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
f04-032-06.png,the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
f04-032-07.png,"in which she had died , there was nothing on"
f04-032-08.png,"which to proceed , and the inquest was"
f04-032-09.png,adjourned .
f04-035-00.png,Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
f04-035-01.png,trails . It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
f04-035-02.png,"money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for"
f04-035-03.png,a detailed account of his movements on the 11th . The dead
f04-035-04.png,woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
f04-035-05.png,named Brown .
f04-039-00.png,This man agreed that his engagement had
f04-039-01.png,been broken off after one particular
f04-039-02.png,"tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any"
f04-039-03.png,money . All the while the police were casting about
f04-039-04.png,for a man who had been seen leaving the train
f04-039-05.png,at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual
f04-039-06.png,"as a man of about thirty , of medium height , with"
f04-039-07.png,"a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat"
f04-039-08.png,and a top-hat .
f04-043-00.png,The porter at the station bore out this
f04-043-01.png,"description , but the man was not traced ."
f04-043-02.png,"Perhaps the news of their search got around ,"
f04-043-03.png,for a man did obligingly present himself
f04-043-04.png,"at Wandsworth police-station , claiming to have"
f04-043-05.png,committed the murder - but he was mentally
f04-043-06.png,"defective , and , despite his claim to infamy ,"
f04-043-07.png,had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .
f04-046-00.png,"Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body , which"
f04-046-01.png,"had at first been considered as belonging to the killer ,"
f04-046-02.png,"proved yet another red herring , for it was learned that"
f04-046-03.png,they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one
f04-046-04.png,of her sisters . A young man from Reading named Marshall
f04-046-05.png,had an uncomfortable time in the presence of the coroner .
f04-049-00.png,"This man was known to have left his home on February 11 , and"
f04-049-01.png,"to have been away for four days . Not in itself a crime , but , added to"
f04-049-02.png,the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
f04-049-03.png,"dford for a false moustache , it left him with something to"
f04-049-04.png,explain . His story was that he had left home to try to
f04-049-05.png,join the Army ( presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
f04-049-06.png,"his military bearing ) , and this was accepted ."
f04-053-00.png,"And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with"
f04-053-01.png,"adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return"
f04-053-02.png,"a verdict of "" wilful murder against some person or"
f04-053-03.png,"persons unknown . "" The most vital clue of the Wedgwood"
f04-053-04.png,pestle had been of no assistance . The killer must
f04-053-05.png,have been very thankful that the science of
f04-053-06.png,dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings .
f04-057-00.png,"The next female fatality occurred eight years later ,"
f04-057-01.png,yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
f04-057-02.png,a further seven years before even a ghost of a
f04-057-03.png,solution emerged . There has always been something
f04-057-04.png,sinister in the idea of tunnels . The building of
f04-057-05.png,them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
f04-057-06.png,nected with railway construction ; and there
f04-057-07.png,were many people who believed that to travel
f04-057-08.png,through tunnels would be an equally
f04-057-09.png,hazardous business .
f04-061-00.png,Some thought that the result would be all
f04-061-01.png,sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
f04-061-02.png,"confined atmosphere . "" The shareholders who travel"
f04-061-03.png,"by it will be so heartily sick , what with the"
f04-061-04.png,"foul air , smoke and sulphur , that the mention"
f04-061-05.png,"of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha , """
f04-061-06.png,wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
f04-061-07.png,proposed to build the Box Tunnel .
f04-064-00.png,The mere thought of subterranean travel
f04-064-01.png,gave others a feeling of danger . A medical journal
f04-064-02.png,"said , "" the deafening peal of thunder , the sudden"
f04-064-03.png,"immersion in gloom , and the clash of reverberated"
f04-064-04.png,sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
f04-064-05.png,"momentary shudder , or idea of destruction , a thrill"
f04-064-06.png,"of annihilation . "" It was also prophesied that"
f04-064-07.png,passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
f04-064-08.png,darkness .
f04-068-00.png,"For all that , as far as England is concerned ,"
f04-068-01.png,there have been only two occasions on
f04-068-02.png,which a body has been found in a tunnel
f04-068-03.png,in circumstances pointing to murder .
f04-068-04.png,"The first was that of Mr Gold , in the famous"
f04-068-05.png,"Lefroy case , and by an odd chance the second tragedy"
f04-068-06.png,"occurred on the same line , although this time the"
f04-068-07.png,victim was a woman .
f04-071-00.png,Though in the minds of most people there was
f04-071-01.png,no doubt that the woman had been the victim
f04-071-02.png,"of foul play , the verdict brought in was that there"
f04-071-03.png,was not sufficient evidence to show whether
f04-071-04.png,she had fallen or been thrown from a train .
f04-071-05.png,"The Merstham Tunnel , on the London-to-"
f04-071-06.png,"Brighton line , is approximately one mile long ,"
f04-071-07.png,and some time before midnight on September

f04-071-09.png,"the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway ,"
f04-074-00.png,It was the battered and broken body of a woman .
f04-074-01.png,He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
f04-074-02.png,"Station , and a stretcher party took the body to"
f04-074-03.png,the Feathers Hotel to await identification .
f04-074-04.png,"Was it a case of suicide , where some unhappy soul"
f04-074-05.png,had walked deliberately into the blackness and
f04-074-06.png,into the path of some train ? This hardly seemed
f04-074-07.png,"likely , since , when she was examined by a local"
f04-074-08.png,"doctor , the woman , young , small , and rather plump ,"
f04-074-09.png,was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
f04-074-10.png,"almost tight enough to strangle her , and the ends"
f04-074-11.png,thrust in her mouth like a gag .
f04-079-00.png,"Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising ,"
f04-079-01.png,and there were other injuries on her body which had
f04-079-02.png,occurred before her death was ensured by some
f04-079-03.png,train which had roared through the tunnel . There were
f04-079-04.png,no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
f04-079-05.png,"fication , no money , and no railway ticket . By then"
f04-079-06.png,reports were being gathered about all traffic over
f04-079-07.png,"this stretch of line , but no information was"
f04-079-08.png,forthcoming about any carriage with an open
f04-079-09.png,"door , nor any passenger reporting an incident"
f04-079-10.png,which might relate .
f04-083-00.png,So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
f04-083-01.png,long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
f04-083-02.png,remained a mystery until later the following day .
f04-083-03.png,During that time a description of the girl was
f04-083-04.png,"circulated , and a Mr Robert Money came forward to"
f04-083-05.png,"identify her as his sister , Mary Money , aged twenty-two ."

f04-096-03.png,a first-class compartment of the
f04-096-04.png,train from London Bridge of which
f04-096-05.png,he was in charge . The two could
f04-096-06.png,have joined this train by taking

f07-002-07.png,meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
f07-002-08.png,homely and protecting flame .

g01-008-04.png,"something to show , he foolishly attempted to besiege"
g01-008-05.png,the well-protected fortress of St Malo . This
g01-008-06.png,involved the dreary method of mining operations in
g01-008-07.png,"which Gaunt , under the Black Prince , had shown"
g01-008-08.png,considerable skill at the siege of Limoges .
g01-012-00.png,"When all seemed to be going well , a sortie surprised"
g01-012-01.png,moment had charge of the mine ; the mine collapsed
g01-012-02.png,fame and glory . Gaunt was compelled to return
g01-012-03.png,"even despised failure . The ' ribald ' Londoners , who"
g01-012-04.png,"Hawley , were also expressing their disappointment"
g01-012-05.png,comparing the failure of a subsidized duke

g01-016-00.png,These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
g01-016-01.png,obvious morals for those who are judges long
g01-016-02.png,"after the event . It seems obvious that , though"
g01-016-03.png,the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
g01-016-04.png,"plate and mail of French knights , a brilliant"
g01-016-05.png,"battle was no substitute for a sound policy ,"
g01-016-06.png,"and that , if archers had no target , campaigns"
g01-016-07.png,became mere marauding route marches .
g01-019-00.png,It seems obvious that if an expedition to
g01-019-01.png,"Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais ,"
g01-019-02.png,then the primary essential to the success
g01-019-03.png,of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
g01-019-04.png,command of the Channel . It seems obvious
g01-019-05.png,that divided forces were dissipating the
g01-019-06.png,advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
g01-019-07.png,"Calais , Cherbourg , Brest , Bordeaux and Bayonne ,"
g01-019-08.png,and that there was no hope of final victory
g01-019-09.png,without a large-scale and concentrated invasion .
g01-022-00.png,BUT NONE OF THESE DEDUCTIONS WERE
g01-022-01.png,"DRAWN AT THE TIME , BECAUSE LARGE-"

g01-022-07.png,ANCING A RULING CLASS WHICH
g01-022-08.png,DESPISED THEM . THE COMMONS WERE
g01-022-09.png,GLAD ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE FRUITS
g01-025-00.png,In this cruel process which was
g01-025-01.png,hammering out nations on the anvils of
g01-025-02.png,"war , there was a constant stirring of"
g01-025-03.png,those in authority to find some simple
g01-025-04.png,way out of the complicated financial
g01-025-05.png,"6impasse which always resulted , and in the"
g01-025-06.png,story of the experiments and expedients
g01-025-07.png,to which the Exchequer resorted is
g01-025-08.png,the story of the prelude to the
g01-025-09.png,Peasants' Revolt of 1381 .
g01-027-00.png,"In appreciating this story , modern con-"
g01-027-01.png,ceptions of governmental duties must be
g01-027-02.png,set aside . A modern government needs
g01-027-03.png,taxation not merely for defence and
g01-027-04.png,offence but for a very wide range of
g01-027-05.png,social services . A mediaeval oligarchy
g01-027-06.png,needed taxation in order to supplement
g01-027-07.png,the private wealth of the monarchy
g01-027-08.png,( the royal income from the revenues of
g01-027-09.png,"crown lands , the fees of feudalism"
g01-031-00.png,Social service as a function of government
g01-031-01.png,was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
g01-031-02.png,substitute was the mutual self-help of
g01-031-03.png,"communities , whether those communities were"
g01-031-04.png,"monasteries , manors , townships , or wards and"
g01-031-05.png,guilds of a city . A mediaeval tax was
g01-031-06.png,therefore in essence a forced payment whose
g01-031-07.png,return was the uncertain bounty of booty
g01-031-08.png,and the vague advantages of military glory ;
g01-031-09.png,it was therefore always granted grudgingly
g01-031-10.png,"and coupled with the vain hope that , in the"
g01-034-00.png,When ' his ' war did not bring victory and
g01-034-01.png,"booty , a new group of Lords might oust"
g01-034-02.png,"the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons ,"
g01-034-03.png,"who usually supplied the hard cash , might"
g01-034-04.png,be bold enough to demand the production of
g01-034-05.png,"accounts , and even at times the impeachment of"
g01-034-06.png,the unsuccessful . But the Commons were not
g01-034-07.png,"the people , and even a full Parliament was"
g01-034-08.png,not yet a true mirror of the nation .
g01-037-00.png,The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's
g01-037-01.png,' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the
g01-037-02.png,feudal obligations of work or villeins who
g01-037-03.png,"had bought their release , free labourers"
g01-037-04.png,"who worked for the highest bidders , free"
g01-037-05.png,yeomen who had prospered enough to become
g01-037-06.png,"successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen ,"
g01-037-07.png,journeymen and small tradesmen of the
g01-037-08.png,"towns , and the retainers and men-at-arms"
g01-037-09.png,in the pay of landed Lords .
g01-039-00.png,"None of these classes , except the yeomen , paid or"
g01-039-01.png,expected to pay direct taxes . During the four-
g01-039-02.png,"teenth century , the traditional methods of"
g01-039-03.png,financing the Exchequer had become stabilized .
g01-039-04.png,When the King and his Council required additio-
g01-039-05.png,"nal funds , they were usually granted an"
g01-039-06.png,"export tax on the wool trade , collected by"
g01-039-07.png,means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that
g01-039-08.png,"prices , quality and tax could be efficiently su-"
g01-039-09.png,"pervised and controlled , together with a"
g01-043-00.png,There were two other sources of public revenue -
g01-043-01.png,"first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead"
g01-043-02.png,of the Commons and in its own Convocations
g01-043-03.png,"granted equivalent contributions , and second ,"
g01-043-04.png,"the foreign merchants , with whom the King's"
g01-043-05.png,officials had formerly made private bargains
g01-043-06.png,"at ' colloquies of merchants ' , and whose"
g01-043-07.png,payments were now authorized by parliamentary
g01-043-08.png,sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
g01-043-09.png,excess of the rate for native merchants .
g01-045-00.png,"In addition to these revenues , the King had the"
g01-045-01.png,financial benefits of his position at the head
g01-045-02.png,"of the feudal system , as its chief landowner"
g01-045-03.png,and the recipient of the fines of royal justice .
g01-045-04.png,"It was , therefore , a complicated and not very"
g01-045-05.png,satisfactory financial system in which the
g01-045-06.png,borders between private and public purse were
g01-045-07.png,as ill-defined as the borders between private
g01-045-08.png,"and national war , and in which the comparati-"
g01-045-09.png,vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
g01-067-00.png,But this time there was a very interesting
g01-067-01.png,attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
g01-067-02.png,payments demanded . The definition of an
g01-067-03.png,"adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' ,"
g01-067-04.png,"and , where the poorest were to pay a groat ,"
g01-067-05.png,the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
g01-067-06.png,"of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks ,"
g01-067-07.png,and between these two extremes a graduated
g01-067-08.png,scale of payments was fixed for the
g01-067-09.png,different classes of laymen and clerics .
g01-070-00.png,Again the resentment was widespread and
g01-070-01.png,the results disappointing - a tax estimated
g01-070-02.png,"to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 ."
g01-070-03.png,"In the following year , 1380 , the last and"
g01-070-04.png,most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
g01-070-05.png,by a Parliament which met at Northampton .
g01-070-06.png,There were dark reasons for a meeting so
g01-070-07.png,far away from the capital in a town with
g01-070-08.png,poor communications and not over supplied
g01-070-09.png,with hostelries and lodgings .
g01-074-00.png,London was again in turmoil ; but this time
g01-074-01.png,over a question of trade rivalry . A rich mer-
g01-074-02.png,"chant from Genoa had been murdered , and"
g01-074-03.png,"John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of"
g01-074-04.png,those charged with the crime . It is clear
g01-074-05.png,from the chronicles that this was a sordid
g01-074-06.png,quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
g01-074-07.png,The city merchants were jealous of foreign
g01-074-08.png,merchants who could tempt court and
g01-074-09.png,baronage with rarer luxuries than those
g01-083-00.png,"A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure"
g01-083-01.png,"to mediaeval eyes . It was determined that 100,000"
g01-083-02.png,"was a fairer target , and the Parliament agreed to find"
g01-083-03.png,two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied
g01-083-04.png,the remainder . The method of assessment to which the
g01-083-05.png,Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax . The manifest
g01-083-06.png,injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
g01-083-07.png,"corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax ,"
g01-083-08.png,"but this lesson was ignored , and the injustice trebled in"
g01-083-09.png,weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult
g01-083-10.png,"had to pay three groats , but this time an adult was re-"
g01-088-00.png,Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
g01-088-01.png,"arithmetic which argued that , as the first"
g01-088-02.png,"poll-tax had supplied 22,000 , a tax of"
g01-088-03.png,"three times the rate would produce 66,000 ."
g01-088-04.png,The only concession made in view of the
g01-088-05.png,objections to the first two poll-taxes was
g01-088-06.png,the suggestion that the rich should help
g01-088-07.png,the poor - but this was only a pious hope
g01-088-08.png,because no machinery was provided for
g01-088-09.png,"carrying it into effect , and a subordinate"

g04-022-00.png,"After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit"
g04-022-01.png,"Germany for ten years , by which time in"
g04-022-02.png,1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
g04-022-03.png,Towards the end of my five and a half years'
g04-022-04.png,incumbency I was asked if I would start
g04-022-05.png,a village choral society and conduct it .
g04-022-06.png,"This opened up a new interest , and we plunged"
g04-022-07.png,into it .
g04-026-00.png,First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
g04-026-01.png,any idea of reading music . This was the village doctor who was an
g04-026-02.png,old school friend at Clifton . He could sustain the tenor part quite well
g04-026-03.png,and lead the others . As for basses and altos the conductor had to
g04-026-04.png,"teach by singing the parts with them . It was very amusing , and by"
g04-026-05.png,the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
g04-026-06.png,could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
g04-032-00.png,Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
g04-032-01.png,"Wedding Feast . ' Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we"
g04-032-02.png,"gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster ,"
g04-032-03.png,and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector .
g04-032-04.png,"Friends from Limpsfield , in addition to the villagers , came up ,"
g04-032-05.png,and we were all happy .
g04-036-00.png,"IN 1913 Dr. Burge , Bishop of Southwark , asked me to go as"
g04-036-01.png,"Vicar of St. Mark's , Woodcote , Purley , a new church built"
g04-036-02.png,"by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne ,"
g04-036-03.png,"who was to become a very intimate friend , and I was"
g04-036-04.png,later on joint executor of his estate with his
g04-036-05.png,solicitor cousin . As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
g04-036-06.png,"ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held"
g04-036-07.png,great family consultations .
g04-039-00.png,My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
g04-039-01.png,"his family , and found a very suitable house nearby"
g04-039-02.png,"where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926"
g04-039-03.png,at the age of 92 . Dr. Burge was not able to be present
g04-039-04.png,at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's .
g04-039-05.png,"This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich ,"
g04-039-06.png,"Dr. John Leake , who lived at Blackheath , and was"
g04-039-07.png,a close friend of ours .
g04-043-00.png,But what a change from the dear little old church
g04-043-01.png,at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
g04-043-02.png,"at Purley . One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the"
g04-043-03.png,"church was , it had its own atmosphere , and for centuries"
g04-043-04.png,had been a House of Prayer . I could not but feel the
g04-043-05.png,"chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is ."
g04-043-06.png,When we had found a group of people who gladly
g04-043-07.png,"co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place"
g04-043-08.png,of daily prayer .
g04-048-00.png,I suggested to the congregation that it needed
g04-048-01.png,"warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we"
g04-048-02.png,found many to help . Gifts of candlesticks and
g04-048-03.png,stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
g04-048-04.png,helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
g04-048-05.png,for prayer and quiet . In time we received similar
g04-048-06.png,"gifts for the High Altar , and large East and West"
g04-048-07.png,windows .
g04-052-00.png,It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
g04-052-01.png,such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
g04-052-02.png,a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
g04-052-03.png,"the architect , himself a fine artist . It is quite possible"
g04-052-04.png,to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
g04-052-05.png,and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
g04-052-06.png,table to the environs .
g04-055-00.png,We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
g04-055-01.png,"the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses ."
g04-055-02.png,This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
g04-055-03.png,"there , but was soon changed into the better-"
g04-055-04.png,sounding name of Lansdowne Road . There
g04-055-05.png,"were lots of children there , and we had"
g04-055-06.png,a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
g04-055-07.png,service . I soon saw that the parish needed
g04-055-08.png,more help both at the church and Mission
g04-055-09.png,district .
g04-060-00.png,The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
g04-060-01.png,"Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the"
g04-060-02.png,church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays .
g04-060-03.png,Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in
g04-060-04.png,"1913 soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission"
g04-060-05.png,"district and got to know , and be known by , many of"
g04-060-06.png,the people of the parish .
g04-063-00.png,A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
g04-063-01.png,"year , 1914 , when war broke out . Very soon Chaplains for"
g04-063-02.png,"the Forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly"
g04-063-03.png,"that one of us must volunteer . The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did"
g04-063-04.png,"not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the parish"
g04-063-05.png,"for a year . Mr. Evitt , however , was much less committed"
g04-063-06.png,"than his Vicar , and he was accepted at once and"
g04-063-07.png,was very soon in France where he did splendid
g04-063-08.png,work until his health broke down and he had a bad
g04-063-09.png,attack of enteric fever .
g04-068-00.png,Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
g04-068-01.png,co-operation especially with the other Christian communities .
g04-068-02.png,At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
g04-068-03.png,' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees
g04-068-04.png,"I found myself deeply involved . At first , the main work was to help"
g04-068-05.png,wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
g04-068-06.png,"allowances , but soon , alas ! , as casualties began and increased"
g04-068-07.png,in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
g04-068-08.png,"became very urgent , and I was asked to be Chairman"
g04-068-09.png,of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
g04-072-00.png,"Indeed , for the next seventeen years , during my time at"
g04-072-01.png,"Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously"
g04-072-02.png,Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee . This
g04-072-03.png,task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
g04-072-04.png,"the Committee . We had a splendid body of local residents ,"
g04-072-05.png,and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries . Our
g04-072-06.png,"Committee met once a week in the evenings , and"
g04-072-07.png,included professional men from every walk of
g04-072-08.png,life .
g04-077-00.png,Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
g04-077-01.png,were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen . Life was
g04-077-02.png,in those years more than busy . We now had a vicarage next
g04-077-03.png,"to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight"
g04-077-04.png,years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
g04-077-05.png,well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
g04-077-06.png,church .
g04-081-00.png,On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
g04-081-01.png,Purley she offered to come and look after me . She was
g04-081-02.png,"a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic"
g04-081-03.png,"things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , '"
g04-081-04.png,who was the only other occupant of the house when
g04-081-05.png,Mr. Evitt had gone .
g04-088-00.png,We gathered together a splendid Sunday
g04-088-01.png,"afternoon service at the church , each child"
g04-088-02.png,"being given a number which , as they came into"
g04-088-03.png,"church , they could just whisper to"
g04-088-04.png,the superintendent who filled in the regi-
g04-088-05.png,ster at her own home . Each child had a
g04-088-06.png,picture given them and the lesson was
g04-088-07.png,largely based on this . It was on a
g04-088-08.png,stamp which could be stuck in
g04-088-09.png,"their book , and there was quite a"
g04-088-10.png,clamour for back stamps if a child
g04-088-11.png,had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
g04-092-00.png,It was quite amusing to see how much
g04-092-01.png,"the children enjoyed the service , and I heard"
g04-092-02.png,of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
g04-092-03.png,naughty child with the penalty of not being
g04-092-04.png,allowed to come to the Children's Church
g04-092-05.png,on Sunday afternoon . I hope the threat
g04-092-06.png,"kept them good in the week , but anyway"
g04-092-07.png,"they were a most delightful lot , and"
g04-092-08.png,it is a great joy to meet them now
g04-092-09.png,fifty years afterwards when so many
g04-092-10.png,are parents or even grandparents
g04-095-00.png,Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
g04-095-01.png,me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
g04-095-02.png,lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
g04-095-03.png,continuing till old age to-day . When I went
g04-095-04.png,"to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was"
g04-095-05.png,"with the Vicar's Warden , Mr. F. W. Charlton"
g04-095-06.png,"and his family , the youngest of whose three"
g04-095-07.png,sons was just coming into the world in this year
g04-095-08.png,of 1913 .
g04-098-00.png,From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
g04-098-01.png,deep friendship which I have taken with me through
g04-098-02.png,all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry . Mr. and
g04-098-03.png,Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
g04-098-04.png,"years of war , when most lives were upset and"
g04-098-05.png,"some tempers were easily frayed , the most"
g04-098-06.png,loyal and devoted friends .
g04-101-00.png,Their homes - for since those years they have
g04-101-01.png,lived on in Purley - have always been
g04-101-02.png,"havens of rest , and the welcome has never"
g04-101-03.png,"failed . Their three boys , now successful men ,"
g04-101-04.png,were in our Children's Church from the
g04-101-05.png,"outset , and when we don't see one"
g04-101-06.png,another we do not forget .
g04-104-00.png,"In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full"
g04-104-01.png,both in the parish and in the wider war activities .
g04-104-02.png,"The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in"
g04-104-03.png,"Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards"
g04-104-04.png,"at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners ."
g04-104-05.png,"I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them"
g04-104-06.png,"frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with"
g04-104-07.png,the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
g04-104-08.png,someone who knew their native villages .
g04-108-00.png,I could at once notice the great antagonism
g04-108-01.png,between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
g04-108-02.png,scorned these more simple country folk .
g05-087-00.png,Less than no response from the Russian side led
g05-087-01.png,one to fear that the event might well have the
g05-087-02.png,outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
g05-087-03.png,lead to disaster . Then there had been much talk of
g05-087-04.png,the setting up among the German population of a
g05-087-05.png,"general system of "" francs-tireurs "" , to be named"
g05-087-06.png,""" Werewolves "" ."
g05-094-00.png,The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
g05-094-01.png,more than a fantasy . Thanks to the good
g05-094-02.png,"sense of the front line soldiers , the"
g05-094-03.png,meeting of East and West was marked by
g05-094-04.png,the use of no weapon more lethal than
g05-094-05.png,vodka . And the effect on the German people
g05-094-06.png,of the first ten years of the promised
g05-094-07.png,"thousand of Nazi rule , so far from creating"
g05-094-08.png,"a spirit of warlike frenzy , had produced"
g05-094-09.png,universally a dull bewildered apathy .
g05-098-00.png,So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the
g05-098-01.png,""" Werewolves "" that we had contemplated the necessity of very"
g05-098-02.png,special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen . Particular
g05-098-03.png,"hatred , we felt , was bound to be aimed at the representatives of"
g05-098-04.png,"those who had , over the years , spread such ghastly havoc , destruction"
g05-098-05.png,"and death over Germany , causing such wholesale slaughter among"
g05-098-06.png,"men , women and children , old and young alike ."

g07-007a-01.png,"BOOK ON BYRON AND SHELLEY , TRELAWNY"
g07-007a-02.png,IMPLIES THAT NOT ONLY GAMBA BUT FLETCHER
g07-007a-03.png,"AND TITA AND THE STEWARD , LEGA ZAMBELLI ,"
g07-007a-04.png,FAILED TO PERFORM THE MOST ELEMENTARY
g07-007a-05.png,DUTIES TOWARDS THE DEAD . HE PRETENDS
g07-007a-06.png,TO HAVE FOUND EVERYTHING IN UTTERMOST
g07-007a-07.png,DISORDER - ' TOKENS THAT THE PILGRIM
g07-007a-08.png,"HAD MOST TREASURED , SCATTERED ON THE"
g07-007a-09.png,"FLOOR , - AS RUBBISH OF NO MARKE-"

g07-007b-00.png,In his popular and acutely unreliable book on Byron and
g07-007b-01.png,"Shelley , Trelawny implies that not only Gamba but Fletcher"
g07-007b-02.png,"and Tita and the steward , Lega Zambelli , failed to perform"
g07-007b-03.png,the most elementary duties towards the dead . He pretends
g07-007b-04.png,to have found everything in uttermost disorder - ' tokens that
g07-007b-05.png,"the Pilgrim had most treasured , scattered on the floor , -"
g07-007b-06.png,"as rubbish of no marketable value , and trampled on ' ."
g07-010b-00.png,This was to give colour to his pretext for copying Byron's last
g07-010b-01.png,"letter to his sister , which was that its chance of reaching its"
g07-010b-02.png,destination had seemed slight . The collection of Pietro
g07-010b-03.png,Gamba's letters deposited among the Murray manuscripts show
g07-010b-04.png,that the greatest care was observed in gathering together all the possessions
g07-010b-05.png,of a man whose importance was fully recognized by everyone about
g07-010b-06.png,"him . ' I have had put under Government seal his belongings ,"
g07-010b-07.png,which will be opened by Prince Alexander Mavrocordato
g07-010b-08.png,in my presence and that of certain Englishmen who are
g07-010b-09.png,here .
g07-014-00.png,I have taken an exact inventory of them . '
g07-014-01.png,"Thus on April 21st , several days before"
g07-014-02.png,"Trelawny appeared , Gamba wrote to Lord"
g07-014-03.png,"Sidney Osborne , and his inventory has been"
g07-014-04.png,preserved . The papers were reopened in the
g07-014-05.png,presence of leading Missolonghi officials
g07-014-06.png,in order to make sure that no recent will
g07-014-07.png,was amongst them .
g07-014b-00.png,"I have taken an exact inventory of them . ' Thus on April 21st , several"

g07-014b-04.png,sure that no recent will was amongst them .
g07-018a-00.png,It may have been then that Trelawny contrived to do
g07-018a-01.png,his copying . Considering that Pietro was not above
g07-018a-02.png,twenty-three years of age when he undertook a load
g07-018a-03.png,"of heavy responsibilities , his conduct reveals him as"
g07-018a-04.png,one of the most intelligent as well as the most
g07-018a-05.png,sympathetic of Byron's 6entourage in Greece . With
g07-018a-06.png,his good looks - for he ' carried the passport of a very
g07-018a-07.png,handsome person ' - his good manners and his perfect
g07-018a-08.png,"lack of pretension , he even succeeded in disarming"
g07-018a-09.png,Hobhouse's possessiveness and making him forget how
g07-018a-10.png,"deeply he had disapproved , less than two years"
g07-022a-00.png,"Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed ,"
g07-022a-01.png,and wrote to Lady Byron after she had
g07-022a-02.png,received a visit from him : I have today seen
g07-022a-03.png,Count Gamba - which was very distressing
g07-022a-04.png,for many reasons but quite unavoidable - he
g07-022a-05.png,"is a pleasing , fine looking young man &"
g07-022a-06.png,spoke with great feeling . The unfortunate
g07-022a-07.png,Augusta was in one of her worst states of

g07-026a-06.png,"any eye but her own would see , feeding"
g07-026a-07.png,the stealthy fires of her animosity : and
g07-026a-08.png,"having betrayed him , she had grown to fear"
g07-026a-09.png,and almost to hate him .

g07-028a-00.png,She had dreaded his outpourings of affection
g07-028a-01.png,for her in poetry that he thought would clear
g07-028a-02.png,"her and that only compromised her , and the"
g07-028a-03.png,headstrong folly that tempted him to write on
g07-028a-04.png,"ever more daring themes , teaching the world"
g07-028a-05.png,to guess what repentance and unrepentance
g07-028a-06.png,preyed upon his thoughts .
g07-028b-00.png,She had dreaded his outpourings of affection for
g07-028b-01.png,her in poetry that he thought would clear
g07-028b-02.png,"her and that only compromised her , and #"
g07-028b-03.png,the headstrong folly that tempted him to
g07-028b-04.png,"write on ever more daring themes , teaching"
g07-028b-05.png,the world to guess what repentance and
g07-028b-06.png,unrepentance preyed upon his thoughts .
g07-030-00.png,She had dreaded still more that he might
g07-030-01.png,"return to England , overshadowing her again"
g07-030-02.png,with spiritual and social peril . But this kind
g07-030-03.png,of return was what she could never have
g07-030-04.png,foreseen ... that he # should come back not
g07-030-05.png,"voluble but silent , not beautiful but defaced ,"
g07-030-06.png,not in obloquy but with his praises ringing !
g07-030-07.png,"She could remember now his exciting laughter ,"
g07-030-08.png,"his almost filial love for her , her almost"
g07-030-09.png,maternal love for him .
g07-034-00.png,Above all she could remember the anguish of their
g07-034-01.png,"parting , and how he had been ' convulsed , absolutely"
g07-034-02.png,"convulsed with grief ' . So love revived , and in"
g07-034-03.png,its most sentimental form . While he lived
g07-034-04.png,she had lost touch in her perpetual alarms
g07-034-05.png,with what was best in him ; dead his memory
g07-034-06.png,became sacred to her .
g07-038-00.png,She felt almost as strongly as Hobhouse
g07-038-01.png,# about biographies . Quite apart from the
g07-038-02.png,divagations of her ' poor brother ' - so she
g07-038-03.png,constantly referred to him - there were a
g07-038-04.png,hundred reasons why it would be
g07-038-05.png,objectionable to have the family history
g07-038-06.png,exposed . Whatever latitude she allowed in
g07-038-07.png,the warmth of her kindly nature to others -
g07-038-08.png,or to herself - she believed implicitly in
g07-038-09.png,the moral code she had learned from
g07-038-10.png,"her good grandmother , the Countess of"
g07-042-00.png,She had no desire to see in print that her
g07-042-01.png,"mother , who was to have been a duchess , had"
g07-042-02.png,been involved in a scandalous and ruinous
g07-042-03.png,"divorce , that her father , ' Mad Jack Byron ' , was"
g07-042-04.png,a profligate and a bankrupt who had
g07-042-05.png,squandered every penny two successive wives
g07-042-06.png,had brought him and left the second on
g07-042-07.png,"the verge of destitution , and that he had died"
g07-042-08.png,"a drunkard and perhaps a suicide , hiding"
g07-042-09.png,in France to escape his creditors .
g07-044-00.png,It was no more pleasant for the Hon. Augusta
g07-044-01.png,Leigh to share this kind of story with the world
g07-044-02.png,than it would be for most 20th-century ladies
g07-044-03.png,moving in court circles and having children to
g07-044-04.png,be settled advantageously in life . She had lived
g07-044-05.png,down the rumours which had made the year of
g07-044-06.png,"the Byron separation a nightmare to her , and she"
g07-044-07.png,"had also succeeded , though with an increasing"
g07-044-08.png,"sense of effort , in persuading her little world to"
g07-044-09.png,"avert its eyes from her husband , ' that drone ' ,"
g07-044-10.png,"as # Byron called him , whose career of"
g07-047-00.png,She had earned the right to be left in peace .
g07-047-01.png,"Byron's fame was , of course , very wonderful , but"
g07-047-02.png,it carried with it too many reminders of his
g07-047-03.png,"terrible indiscretions - the writing of Don Juan ,"
g07-047-04.png,"which she had never ceased to deplore , his"
g07-047-05.png,"shocking blasphemies like the Vision of Judgement ,"
g07-047-06.png,his making friends with the atheist known to
g07-047-07.png,"her as ' that infamous Mr. Shelley ' , and his"
g07-047-08.png,mixing with really low and horrid people such
g07-047-09.png,"as the subversive journalist Leigh Hunt , whom"
g07-047-10.png,on would never conceivably meet in decent society .
g07-050-00.png,She was most emphatically opposed to the
g07-050-01.png,"production of sheer indelicacies , and that was"
g07-050-02.png,the light in which she saw the proposed book
g07-050-03.png,by Dallas . Letters between a mother and a son -
g07-050-04.png,a son so outspoken and a mother so far from
g07-050-05.png,suitable to be paraded before the public !
g07-050-06.png,"And brought out by that seedy poor relation ,"
g07-050-07.png,Dallas ! Could anything be in worse taste ?
g07-065-00.png,"Hanson , the solicitor , was naturally remunerated"
g07-065-01.png,"for his services , but all Mr Hobhouse's duties"
g07-065-02.png,as executor were performed without reward .
g07-065-03.png,And now there was more trouble brewing
g07-065-04.png,with those unbearable Dallases . Dallas
g07-065-05.png,senior was detained in Paris by severe
g07-065-06.png,"illness , but Dallas junior was full of"
g07-065-07.png,fight and applying for the injunction
g07-065-08.png,to be lifted .
g07-069a-00.png,"He had gone to Byron's cousin , now 7th"
g07-069a-01.png,"lord , and had got him to compose an"
g07-069a-02.png,"affidavit to the effect that , whereas he"
g07-069a-03.png,had formerly been reluctant to approve the
g07-069a-04.png,publication unless it had first been
g07-069a-05.png,examined by the relatives and friends of
g07-069a-06.png,"his predecessor , he had now read the"
g07-069a-07.png,book and was content for it to be
g07-069a-08.png,issued without that precaution .
g07-071a-00.png,There were few things in Augusta's whole
g07-071a-01.png,"life , full of calamities though it was , that"
g07-071a-02.png,hurt her more than this contemptuous slight
g07-071a-03.png,"from George Anson Byron , whom she had"
g07-071a-04.png,"loved with an unswerving loyalty , and had looked"
g07-071a-05.png,"on as her intimate friend . Moreover , he"
g07-071a-06.png,was without the right to make such
g07-071a-07.png,pronouncements : he had inherited nothing
g07-071a-08.png,"from her brother but his title , whereas"
g07-071a-09.png,she was not only of nearer consanguinity
g07-071a-10.png,but the chosen recipient of his property .
g07-074a-00.png,"These , if she had only known it , were"
g07-074a-01.png,precisely the reasons why her cousin took
g07-074a-02.png,pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her .
g07-074a-03.png,Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have
g07-074a-04.png,"intimate friends , and in every instance where"
g07-074a-05.png,"the occasion was granted her , she managed"
g07-074a-06.png,"to find some excuse for bestowing , in whole"
g07-074a-07.png,"or in part , those confidences which never"
g07-074a-08.png,failed to leave her audience agape with
g07-074a-09.png,wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta's
g07-074a-10.png,wickedness .
g07-077a-00.png,George Anson Byron had seen enough of
g07-077a-01.png,the poet's atrocious conduct as a husband
g07-077a-02.png,"to be aware that Augusta , so far from"
g07-077a-03.png,being responsible for the collapse of the
g07-077a-04.png,"marriage , had been Lady Byron's greatest"
g07-077a-05.png,support and comfort at the time ; but it
g07-077a-06.png,had been deemed necessary all the
g07-077a-07.png,same to enlighten him as to the suspicions
g07-077a-08.png,"in the background , and he had repeated"
g07-077a-09.png,them to his newly married wife .
g07-079a-00.png,Their friendship for Augusta became rather
g07-079a-01.png,"hollow , and the news that Byron had left"
g07-079a-02.png,her practically all his money caused it to
g07-079a-03.png,crumble to oblivion . Though Lady Byron
g07-079a-04.png,"knew perfectly well that Byron , as early"
g07-079a-05.png,"as the year of their wedding , 1815 , had"
g07-079a-06.png,"made a will in Augusta's favour , she had"
g07-079a-07.png,evidently not passed on that information ;
g07-079a-08.png,and it came as an appalling surprise to
g07-079a-09.png,Captain Byron that he had been left
g07-079a-10.png,without the fortune that would keep up the
g07-079a-11.png,title .
g07-084-00.png,"' Respecting the will ' , he wrote to Byron's widow a few days after"
g07-084-01.png,"hearing its contents , ' the very thought of it is painful to me ."
g07-084-02.png,"What Mary has said about it is too true . ' What Mary , the"
g07-084-03.png,"new Lady Byron , had said about it was written on the first half"
g07-084-04.png,"sheet of the same paper : My dearest Annabella , The more we"
g07-084-05.png,"consider the most prominent subject in your letter , the more"
g07-084-06.png,we are convinced of the truth of that dreadful history
g07-084-07.png,connected with it .
h01-000-00.png,Questions about marriage and children were
h01-000-01.png,"again included , as they had been at the"
h01-000-02.png,1911 and 1951 Censuses . The former had asked
h01-000-03.png,"for marriage details for all married women ,"
h01-000-04.png,the latter for all married women under
h01-000-05.png,the age of 50 . The 1961 Census questions
h01-000-06.png,related to all women who were or had been
h01-000-07.png,"married , and so repeated the enquiry made"
h01-000-08.png,fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family
h01-000-09.png,Census conducted on behalf of the Royal
h01-000-10.png,Commission on Population .
h01-004-00.png,"The questions about children were the same as in 1951 ,"
h01-004-01.png,except that they extended to all women who were or had
h01-004-02.png,been married . It was not regarded as practicable within
h01-004-03.png,the limits of the census to include particulars about
h01-004-04.png,"the date of birth of each child , as had been done"
h01-004-05.png,in the specialised enquiry for the Royal Commission .
h01-007-00.png,"The innovation at the 1961 Census , though the"
h01-007-01.png,Family Census had previously included
h01-007-02.png,"the question , was the date of termination"
h01-007-03.png,of the first or only marriage . This enables
h01-007-04.png,statistical use to be made of their experience
h01-007-05.png,as regards duration of marriage and
h01-007-06.png,number of children in the case of women
h01-007-07.png,whose first or only marriage was terminated
h01-007-08.png,by widowhood or divorce after the end
h01-007-09.png,of their child bearing life .
h01-010-00.png,This is particularly important in estimating the trends
h01-010-01.png,in the size and pattern of families for successive
h01-010-02.png,"generations over as long a period as possible , as the"
h01-010-03.png,proportion of widows predominates in the higher age
h01-010-04.png,groups . In Wales and Monmouthshire the question
h01-010-05.png,on the ability to speak Welsh was included as
h01-010-06.png,"previously . The question was first asked in 1891 , and"
h01-010-07.png,was given its present form in 1931 .
h01-014-00.png,Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions
h01-014-01.png,about housing and households . In 1961 the scope of the
h01-014-02.png,"question was wider than before , because of the great"
h01-014-03.png,use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local
h01-014-04.png,"Government and to local authorities . As before , the record"
h01-014-05.png,"made during the enumeration lists all buildings , residen-"
h01-014-06.png,"tial premises and temporary places of abode , and all"
h01-014-07.png,"households occupying them , as the basis of the"
h01-014-08.png,enumeration is the household schedule .
h01-018-00.png,"The number of structurally separate dwellings ( that is ,"
h01-018-01.png,houses or flats or other quarters built or adapted for
h01-018-02.png,separate occupation and forming a private and structurally
h01-018-03.png,"separate unit ) was obtained as previously , together with the"
h01-018-04.png,number of households with sole occupation or sharing
h01-018-05.png,"such dwellings , and the number of living rooms occu-"
h01-018-06.png,pied by each household .
h01-024-00.png,"A new question asked about housing tenure , whether"
h01-024-01.png,the accommodation occupied by each household was held by
h01-024-02.png,them as owner-occupiers ; occupied in connection with
h01-024-03.png,employment or as part of business premises ; rented
h01-024-04.png,from a Council ( or New Town Corporation ) or a private
h01-024-05.png,"landlord ( if so , whether furnished or unfurnished ) ; or"
h01-024-06.png,occupied on some other terms . The analysis of private
h01-024-07.png,households by size and various characteristics of their
h01-024-08.png,members has become increasingly important .
h01-027-00.png,"Previously , while visitors were left out of this"
h01-027-01.png,analysis it was not considered sufficiently
h01-027-02.png,important to attempt the task of bringing
h01-027-03.png,in the members away from home on Census
h01-027-04.png,"night , which would be very laborious in the"
h01-027-05.png,absence of information given at their place
h01-027-06.png,of usual residence ( n log n ) . But the need
h01-027-07.png,for a more accurate distribution of
h01-027-08.png,households by size as usually constituted
h01-027-09.png,"had become more important by 1961 , and"
h01-027-10.png,"accordingly a new question was introduced , ..."
h01-030-00.png,The information collected under
h01-030-01.png,this head will not affect the
h01-030-02.png,"main count of population numbers ,"
h01-030-03.png,but will be used solely in the
h01-030-04.png,analysis of households by size
h01-030-05.png,and other characteristics . Sample . -
h01-030-06.png,At an early stage of the census
h01-030-07.png,preparations consideration was
h01-030-08.png,given to possibilities of reducing
h01-030-09.png,the amount of clerical work before ...
h02-004-00.png,We have held eleven meetings . We decided as a
h02-004-01.png,first step to seek information from a number
h02-004-02.png,of organisations and persons having an interest
h02-004-03.png,in the questions before us and at a later stage we
h02-004-04.png,arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
h02-004-05.png,anybody interested to submit representations . We
h02-004-06.png,compiled a list of the points which we thought
h02-004-07.png,"were of importance , but we made it clear that"
h02-004-08.png,the replies need not be confined to these
h02-004-09.png,particular items .
h02-008-00.png,"As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence , though"
h02-008-01.png,we found it an advantage in certain instances . Appendix
h02-008-02.png,1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted . The
h02-008-03.png,"Department of Health for Scotland , the Home Office and"
h02-008-04.png,the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us ;
h02-008-05.png,officers of these Departments attended our meetings
h02-008-06.png,and have given us valuable assistance .
h02-012-00.png,"On 23rd November , 1959 , we submitted"
h02-012-01.png,an Interim Report . This dealt with two questions
h02-012-02.png,which arose from our terms of reference and
h02-012-03.png,which had been brought specially to our notice .
h02-012-04.png,"First , we were asked to examine the risks"
h02-012-05.png,attending the abuse of carbromal and
h02-012-06.png,bromvaletone and preparations containing these
h02-012-07.png,substances . The Poisons Board had already
h02-012-08.png,"considered this problem but , in the absence of"
h02-012-09.png,sufficient evidence that these compounds
h02-017-00.png,4 . On examination of the evidence it became clear
h02-017-01.png,to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples
h02-017-02.png,of a number of drugs on sale to the public which
h02-017-03.png,were not appropriate for restriction to supply on
h02-017-04.png,"prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act , 1951 ,"
h02-017-05.png,"or the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1956 , and had"
h02-017-06.png,not so far been recommended for control as
h02-017-07.png,poisons .
h02-019-00.png,"5 . We recommended that , in general , any drug or"
h02-019-01.png,pharmaceutical preparation which has an action on the
h02-019-02.png,central nervous system and is liable to produce physical
h02-019-03.png,or psychological deterioration should be confined to supply
h02-019-04.png,on prescription and that an independent expert body
h02-019-05.png,should be responsible for advising which substances
h02-019-06.png,should be so controlled . 6 . As an interim and urgent
h02-019-07.png,"measure , the Secretary of State for the Home Department ,"
h02-019-08.png,"on the recommendation of the Poisons Board , has"
h02-022-00.png,We are glad to note the action that has been taken
h02-022-01.png,and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure
h02-022-02.png,"that , as other preparations affecting the central nervous"
h02-022-03.png,"system become available , they too will be brought to"
h02-022-04.png,"the notice of the Poisons Board , or such other advisory"
h02-022-05.png,body as may in due course be appointed for the
h02-022-06.png,"purpose , to consider whether there are sufficient"
h02-022-07.png,grounds for restricting any of them also to supply
h02-022-08.png,on prescription .
h02-024-00.png,8 . The second part of our Interim Report was
h02-024-01.png,devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted
h02-024-02.png,to the gases and vapours which they use in the
h02-024-03.png,course of their professional duties . We
h02-024-04.png,ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-
h02-024-05.png,"ity was very small indeed . However , over a"
h02-024-06.png,"period of eleven years , patients' lives had been"
h02-024-07.png,endangered in two known instances .
h02-028-00.png,We were assured by our expert witnesses on this
h02-028-01.png,"subject that , with the apparatus at present to hand , the"
h02-028-02.png,preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before
h02-028-03.png,administering them to a patient was a recognised and
h02-028-04.png,necessary precaution . We accepted this . 10 . In view of
h02-028-05.png,the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
h02-028-06.png,anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
h02-028-07.png,to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be
h02-028-08.png,entrusted with their administration .
h02-035-00.png,"The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee , whose advice"
h02-035-01.png,"we were invited to review , were to advise on : ( a ) the"
h02-035-02.png,"circumstances , if any , in which the supply of morphine"
h02-035-03.png,"and heroin , and preparations containing these substances ,"
h02-035-04.png,to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded
h02-035-05.png,as medically advisable ; ( b ) the precautions which medical
h02-035-06.png,practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or
h02-035-07.png,heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
h02-035-08.png,administrative measures that seemed expedient to
h02-035-09.png,secure observance of those precautions .
h02-037-00.png,12 . Through the system of records and
h02-037-01.png,inspection then in operation cases were
h02-037-02.png,brought to the notice of the Home Office
h02-037-03.png,at that time in which exceptionally
h02-037-04.png,large quantities of morphine and heroin
h02-037-05.png,had been supplied to particular practi-
h02-037-06.png,tioners or prescribed for individual
h02-037-07.png,cases . On further enquiry it was
h02-037-08.png,ascertained that sometimes the
h02-037-09.png,doctor had ordered these drugs simply
h02-040-00.png,13 . It appeared then that in some circumstances
h02-040-01.png,dangerous drugs were being supplied in
h02-040-02.png,contravention of the intention of Parliament
h02-040-03.png,that a doctor should be authorised to supply
h02-040-04.png,drugs only so far as was necessary for the
h02-040-05.png,practice of his profession . Before deciding on
h02-040-06.png,measures to secure proper observance of
h02-040-07.png,"the law , it was felt necessary to have"
h02-040-08.png,some authoritative medical advice on various
h02-040-09.png,"aspects of the treatment of addiction , ..."
h02-043-00.png,The Rolleston Committee's recommen-
h02-043-01.png,dations in 1926 on the supply of morphine
h02-043-02.png,and heroin to addicts to these drugs and
h02-043-03.png,on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed
h02-043-04.png,"later in this Report . They have , up to now ,"
h02-043-05.png,been included in the Memorandum on
h02-043-06.png,the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations
h02-043-07.png,which is prepared by the Home Office
h02-043-08.png,for the information of doctors and
h02-043-09.png,dentists .
h02-049-00.png,"The Secretary of State was empowered , on the recommendation of a"
h02-049-01.png,"tribunal , to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply"
h02-049-02.png,"dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor , or a doctor"
h02-049-03.png,"convicted of an offence under the Act , should not issue"
h02-049-04.png,prescriptions for dangerous drugs . ( 3 ) It was made clear
h02-049-05.png,that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified
h02-049-06.png,medical practitioner when required for purposes of
h02-049-07.png,medical treatment .
h04-000-00.png,"Nevertheless , average net family income"
h04-000-01.png,was appreciably higher in families with
h04-000-02.png,"several children than in those with only ,"
h04-000-03.png,many of which were incomplete families
h04-000-04.png,"of younger parents with lower earnings ,"
h04-000-05.png,and of course with lower tax reliefs and
h04-000-06.png,no family allowances . The rise in net family
h04-000-07.png,incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great-
h04-000-08.png,"est for childless couples , especially older"
h04-000-09.png,couples ( probably because of the
h04-007-00.png,"Compared with 1958 , the expenditure index for 1959"
h04-007-01.png,showed increases of 4 to 6 per cent for couples without
h04-007-02.png,"children and those with one child , and much smaller"
h04-007-03.png,changes for couples with several children . The quantity
h04-007-04.png,"index , which has risen only slowly since 1956 , was"
h04-007-05.png,almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more
h04-007-06.png,"children , but rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult"
h04-007-07.png,households and by 1-2 per cent for younger childless
h04-007-08.png,couples and couples with one child .
h04-021-00.png,"As in 1958 , younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent"
h04-021-01.png,"more per calorie than the national average , and families"
h04-021-02.png,with four or more children 19 per cent less . The only
h04-021-03.png,"substantial change was in families with three children ,"
h04-021-04.png,for whom the index declined from 91 to 88 . Table 27
h04-021-05.png,also shows the corresponding values of an index which
h04-021-06.png,compares the prices paid by different types of household
h04-021-07.png,for the commodities constituting the average household
h04-021-08.png,diet in 1959 .
h04-025-00.png,For all foods the range was from 3.6 per cent above the national average
h04-025-01.png,in younger two-adult households to 4.8 per cent below in families with
h04-025-02.png,"four or more children , compared with +3.6 to -5.4 per cent in 1958"
h04-025-03.png,"and +2.8 to -2.6 per cent in 1957 . As with the price of energy index ,"
h04-025-04.png,"the only noteworthy change was for households with three children ,"
h04-025-05.png,in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the average for
h04-025-06.png,all households in the sample .
h04-028-00.png,"The price ranges for milk ,"
h04-028-01.png,"cheese , sugar , bread and flour"
h04-028-02.png,were very narrow . For most other
h04-028-03.png,foods younger childless couples paid
h04-028-04.png,the highest average prices and
h04-028-05.png,"large families the lowest , the price"
h04-028-06.png,gradients being steepest for
h04-028-07.png,"carcase meat ( +7 to -7 per cent ) ,"
h04-028-08.png,""" other "" fish ( +8 to -11 ) , "" other "" vegetables"
h04-028-09.png,( +9 to -9 ) and beverages other than
h04-028-10.png,tea ( +12 to -16 ) .
h04-035-00.png,Consumption by younger childless couples declined
h04-035-01.png,"throughout this period , but that of the smaller families was"
h04-035-02.png,maintained except for the slight fall in 1959 . In the largest
h04-035-03.png,"families , particularly those containing four or more children ,"
h04-035-04.png,there was a tendency for consumption to increase between 1955 and
h04-035-05.png,"1957 , and thereafter to decline . Graduated scales of family"
h04-035-06.png,"allowances were introduced in October 1956 , and the welfare"
h04-035-07.png,milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957 .
h04-049-00.png,75 . The smaller families and the residual groups of
h04-049-01.png,households containing children reduced their consumption
h04-049-02.png,"of sugar and of preserves , but in all other types of"
h04-049-03.png,household a decline in purchases of the one was
h04-049-04.png,accompanied by an increase in consumption of the other .
h04-049-05.png,76 . Most groups spent slightly less on potatoes than in
h04-049-06.png,"the previous year , but consumption was maintained"
h04-049-07.png,except in families with more than one child and in
h04-049-08.png,the unclassified households with children or
h04-049-09.png,adolescents .
h04-052-00.png,All groups except families with four or more children
h04-052-01.png,or with adolescents but no children consumed more fresh green
h04-052-02.png,"vegetables , especially in the first half of the year , although most"
h04-052-03.png,reduced their consumption of other vegetables . Purchases of
h04-052-04.png,"quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased , but extreme-"
h04-052-05.png,"ly wide group differences persisted , the averages ranging from"
h04-052-06.png,0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more
h04-052-07.png,children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult
h04-052-08.png,households ; average consumption by older couples and other
h04-052-09.png,wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head per week .
h04-055-00.png,The two latter groups consumed much smaller
h04-055-01.png,quantities per head of canned vegetables and canned and
h04-055-02.png,"bottled tomatoes than any other group , and much smaller"
h04-055-03.png,quantities of canned and bottled fruit than younger
h04-055-04.png,"childless couples ; in households containing children ,"
h04-055-05.png,consumption of canned fruit fell off sharply with
h04-055-06.png,"increasing family size , but there was no regular"
h04-055-07.png,gradation in purchases of canned vegetables and canned
h04-055-08.png,tomatoes .
h04-057-00.png,All types of household benefited from the improved
h04-057-01.png,supplies and lower prices of fresh fruit compared
h04-057-02.png,"with 1958 , but the increase in consumption was"
h04-057-03.png,least in families containing children . 77 . Total
h04-057-04.png,"bread consumption was virtually unchanged ,"
h04-057-05.png,although most types of household bought less
h04-057-06.png,white bread and more rolls and speciality
h04-057-07.png,breads than in 1958 . Most groups increased
h04-057-08.png,"their purchases of puddings , cakes and biscuits ,"
h04-057-09.png,but obtained less flour .
h04-061-00.png,78 . Regression estimates of the expenditure on
h04-061-01.png,different commodities attributable to the adult
h04-061-02.png,couple and each additional child in a selected
h04-061-03.png,group of households consisting of childless couples
h04-061-04.png,( both under 55 ) and couples with different numbers
h04-061-05.png,of children were given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of
h04-061-06.png,the Annual Report for 1956 . The younger childless
h04-061-07.png,couples are broadly comparable in age and family
h04-061-08.png,"income with the family households , so that differences"
h04-061-09.png,in food expenditure may be associated with the
h04-061-10.png,presence of children .
h04-071-00.png,"The relative expenditure per child declined from 1952 to 1956 ,"
h04-071-01.png,but rose in 1957 when the subsidy on welfare and national dried
h04-071-02.png,milk was reduced ; since 1957 it has again declined . Most of the
h04-071-03.png,"average expenditure associated with a child was on cereal foods ,"
h04-071-04.png,"potatoes and milk ; for fresh green vegetables , fruit , cheese , fish and"
h04-071-05.png,"carcase meat , the incremental expenditure was slight ."
h04-074-00.png,79 . Table 30 shows the energy value and nutrient content of
h04-074-01.png,the diets of households of different composition . The averages
h04-074-02.png,"showed little change compared with those for the previous year ,"
h04-074-03.png,except for generally increased intakes of vitamins C and D .
h04-074-04.png,"Since physiological requirements vary widely with age , sex"
h04-074-05.png,"and level of activity , comparisons between families of different"
h04-074-06.png,composition are only apposite when considered in relation
h04-074-07.png,to needs .
h04-078-00.png,"80 . Estimates of the adequacy of the diets , assessed by"
h04-078-01.png,comparison with allowances based on the recommendations
h04-078-02.png,"of the British Medical Association , are also shown in Table 30 ."
h04-078-03.png,"In comparison with the previous year , changes were small"
h04-078-04.png,except for higher estimates for vitamin C . In families with
h04-078-05.png,four or more children the levels of adequacy for all
h04-078-06.png,nutrients other than vitamin C decreased slightly .
h04-082-00.png,"For this fairly small group , comparisons between different"
h04-082-01.png,years cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a
h04-082-02.png,defined number of children . In 1959 the households in
h04-082-03.png,this group contained slightly more children ( average 4.64 )
h04-082-04.png,than in the previous year ( average 4.53 ) . Their total food
h04-082-05.png,"expenditure increased less than that in other groups ,"
h04-082-06.png,"and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish ,"
h04-082-07.png,"poultry , eggs , canned vegetables , fresh fruit , chocolate"
h04-082-08.png,"biscuits and breakfast cereals which , in general , are more"
h04-082-09.png,expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which
h04-082-10.png,"they purchased less , namely dried milk , potatoes , carcase"
h04-082-11.png,"meat , sugar , bread , flour and oatmeal and oat products ."
h05-012-00.png,5 . Other forms of war damage payment made by the Commission
h05-012-01.png,"are highway payments , clearance payments ( for clearing remains of"
h05-012-02.png,"structures from "" total loss "" sites ) and church payments . Although"
h05-012-03.png,differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of
h05-012-04.png,"works payments , the sums paid under these heads have the"
h05-012-05.png,common feature that they are all payments in respect of works
h05-012-06.png,which have been carried out .
h06-000-00.png,To provide fuller information about certain types of
h06-000-01.png,"dangerous occurrence , Section 65 of the Factories Act ,"
h06-000-02.png,"1937 , requires notification of certain specified"
h06-000-03.png,"occurrences to H.M. District Inspectors of Factories ,"
h06-000-04.png,whether or not they result in injury . Appendix 20
h06-000-05.png,gives figures of dangerous occurrences reported in
h06-000-06.png,1960 ; the types of occurrence which have to be
h06-000-07.png,reported are set out in the heading to the Appendix .
h06-003-00.png,The total number of dangerous occurrences reported
h06-003-01.png,"during the year was 1,409 , an increase of 111 over"
h06-003-02.png,"the total for 1959 . However , the number of"
h06-003-03.png,notifiable accidents associated with occurrences fell
h06-003-04.png,from 252 ( 31 of them fatal ) in 1959 to
h06-003-05.png,245 ( 22 fatal ) in 1960 . The main increase in
h06-003-06.png,the numbers of occurrences reported occurred in the
h06-003-07.png,category of those due to the collapse or
h06-003-08.png,"failure of a crane , derrick , winch or hoist , where"
h06-003-09.png,there was an increase of almost one-third from
h06-003-10.png,335 to 438 .
h06-079-00.png,The equipment takes two forms - an insulating
h06-079-01.png,"guard on the jib of the crane , intended to"
h06-079-02.png,"prevent direct contact with the line , and"
h06-079-03.png,electronic equipment with a sensitive probe
h06-079-04.png,mounted slightly forward of the head of the
h06-079-05.png,jib and with electronic assembly
h06-079-06.png,and warning apparatus in the driver's
h06-079-07.png,cab . Improved designs of both forms
h06-079-08.png,are being tried out at present .
h06-082-00.png,"There is , however , a danger that workers"
h06-082-01.png,will rely too much on fixed devices because
h06-082-02.png,they fail to recognise their limitations .
h06-082-03.png,It is therefore safer both in principle and
h06-082-04.png,practice to keep the worker away from
h06-082-05.png,"overhead lines wherever possible , e.g. , by"
h06-082-06.png,"( 1 ) re-routing the line , ( 2 ) putting the supply"
h06-082-07.png,"underground , ( 3 ) making the line"
h06-082-08.png,dead ( after consultation with the supply
h06-082-09.png,"authority ) , ( 4 ) providing barriers at a safe"
h06-082-10.png,distance to prevent vehicles from approaching
h06-085-00.png,It is also important to remember that on
h06-085-01.png,lines carrying the higher voltages flashover
h06-085-02.png,from the line may take place without
h06-085-03.png,actual contact . A new type of
h06-085-04.png,machine has recently been developed for
h06-085-05.png,the automatic rolling of sole leather
h06-085-06.png,bends . The sheet of leather is placed
h06-085-07.png,on a sliding feed tray outside the
h06-085-08.png,danger zone and is then pushed
h06-085-09.png,"forward between two platens , the upper"
h06-085-10.png,one carrying a set of small rollers .
h06-089-00.png,"The lower platen , which supports the"
h06-089-01.png,"leather , is raised hydraulically to bring"
h06-089-02.png,it into contact with the rollers on the upper
h06-089-03.png,"platen , which is then caused to make"
h06-089-04.png,several horizontal oscillations so that the
h06-089-05.png,leather is rolled and pressed at the same time .
h06-089-06.png,The danger zone between the platens is fenced
h06-089-07.png,by a guard which is interlocked with the
h06-089-08.png,hydraulic valve and the press is also
h06-089-09.png,sequentially operated : the closing of the shutter
h06-089-10.png,"starts the machine , the rest of the cycle"
h06-089-11.png,following automatically .
h06-092-00.png,A new method of applying sand to the
h06-092-01.png,faces of green bricks has recently been
h06-092-02.png,developed . In the case of wire-cut bricks
h06-092-03.png,the column of clay from the pug-mill is
h06-092-04.png,carried by a short length of belt

h07-000-01.png,"development corporations , about 20 per cent represents"
h07-000-02.png,extensions built after the firms had become established .
h07-000-03.png,It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-
h07-000-04.png,rents or ground rents for their factories or industrial
h07-000-05.png,sites ; and rents vary considerably according to the demand
h07-000-06.png,for factory accommodation .
h07-003-00.png,The average gross return on established industrial estates
h07-003-01.png,"ranges from 7 to 9 per cent of the capital expenditure on land ,"
h07-003-02.png,site works and buildings . Manufacturing industry affords
h07-003-03.png,employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as
h07-003-04.png,manual workers . An analysis made by Crawley Development
h07-003-05.png,"Corporation in 1958 , after collating replies from fifty-eight"
h07-003-06.png,"manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff ,"
h07-003-07.png,showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as
h07-003-08.png,"managerial and administrative , 11 per cent as technical"
h07-003-09.png,or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical .
h07-007-00.png,There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to
h07-007-01.png,Crawley . The development corporations have aimed at a varied
h07-007-02.png,"pattern of industry , offering a reasonable choice of"
h07-007-03.png,"employer as well as choice of occupation for men , women and"
h07-007-04.png,"school-leavers , with due regard to the industries"
h07-007-05.png,"already established in their towns . Inevitably engineering ,"
h07-007-06.png,"including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries ,"
h07-007-07.png,predominates in all the London new towns since these are
h07-007-08.png,among the industries which have expanded most
h07-007-09.png,during the last ten years in the country generally .
h07-011-00.png,Of those at present employed in manufacturing industry
h07-011-01.png,in the eight London new towns about 40 per cent are
h07-011-02.png,employed in engineering and electrical goods manufacture -
h07-011-03.png,the proportion employed in both these groups combined
h07-011-04.png,varies from about 30 per cent in Welwyn to 85 per cent in
h07-011-05.png,Stevenage and 90 per cent in Hatfield .
h07-013-00.png,These figures are much higher than the national
h07-013-01.png,"averages , and may be thought to indicate a"
h07-013-02.png,lack of balance in some of the towns . On the other
h07-013-03.png,hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of
h07-013-04.png,skilled employment and are highly diversified
h07-013-05.png,"as regards products , markets and methods of"
h07-013-06.png,manufacture . Consumer goods industries such as the
h07-013-07.png,"manufacture of food # and drink , tobacco , clothing"
h07-013-08.png,and footwear are under-represented in the new
h07-013-09.png,towns generally though not in Basildon and
h07-013-10.png,Welwyn .
h07-017-00.png,The following table indicates the size of the
h07-017-01.png,"firms , some of them occupying more than"
h07-017-02.png,"one factory , introduced or sponsored by"
h07-017-03.png,development corporations in the new towns : The
h07-017-04.png,overall average for the factories sponsored by
h07-017-05.png,development corporations is about 170 employees
h07-017-06.png,"per firm , and the average for each of the London"
h07-017-07.png,"new towns is roughly the same except at Hatfield ,"
h07-017-08.png,"where it is much lower , and Stevenage , where it"
h07-017-09.png,is much higher .
h07-020-00.png,The position at Stevenage is accounted for by
h07-020-01.png,"the presence of one firm with 3,700 employees"
h07-020-02.png,"and two others with over 1,000 employees ."
h07-020-03.png,About 32 per cent of all the workers employed
h07-020-04.png,in factories sponsored by the development
h07-020-05.png,corporations are employed by the eleven
h07-020-06.png,largest firms and about 23 per cent by the next
h07-020-07.png,group of firms employing between five
h07-020-08.png,hundred and one thousand workers .
h07-023-00.png,In factories sponsored by the London new town
h07-023-01.png,development corporations the proportion of
h07-023-02.png,"female employees , expressed as a percentage"
h07-023-03.png,"of all employees , varies from 23 per cent in"
h07-023-04.png,Welwyn Garden City and 24 per cent in
h07-023-05.png,Hemel Hempstead to 35 per cent in
h07-023-06.png,Basildon and 55 per cent in Hatfield
h07-023-07.png,with an average of about 30 per cent
h07-023-08.png,- rather less than in the country as a whole .

j01-042-00.png,Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given
j01-042-01.png,material in the sodium coolant circuit will start to
j01-042-02.png,oxidise the cell can only be used as has been
j01-042-03.png,"suggested above , as an oxygen concentration monitor ."
j01-042-04.png,"However , if a material oxidizes in sodium at a given"
j01-042-05.png,oxygen potential the reference electrode could be held
j01-042-06.png,at that potential and oxidizing or reducing conditions
j01-042-07.png,in the coolant circuit for that material would be
j01-042-08.png,indicated by a negative or positive potential at the
j01-042-09.png,reference electrode .
j01-045-00.png,Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium
j01-045-01.png,circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference
j01-045-02.png,electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated
j01-045-03.png,with niobium separated from the coolant by a
j01-045-04.png,solid anionic electrolyte . A negative voltage from
j01-045-05.png,the reference electrode would mean oxidizing
j01-045-06.png,"conditions for niobium and positive voltage , non-"
j01-045-07.png,oxidizing conditions . The practical application of
j01-045-08.png,the above idea will involve considerable experimenta-
j01-045-09.png,tion before it can be realised .
j01-049-00.png,The first requirement is for an anionic
j01-049-01.png,"electrolyte , which can be fabricated into"
j01-049-02.png,suitable shapes impervious to gases and
j01-049-03.png,liquid sodium and which is neither
j01-049-04.png,corroded by sodium nor by sodium
j01-049-05.png,monoxide . Possible materials are zirconia
j01-049-06.png,stabilised with lime and thoria doped
j01-049-07.png,with rare earth oxides .
j01-059-00.png,Provided the temperatures at C and E are
j01-059-01.png,"the same , thermoelectric contributions to the"
j01-059-02.png,voltage should be zero . The probe extends
j01-059-03.png,out of the sodium stream through a close
j01-059-04.png,fitting thin walled T-Junction F and passes
j01-059-05.png,into the open via a water-cooled O ring seal G .
j01-059-06.png,The open end of the probe is sealed with
j01-059-07.png,a vacuum coupling H which also positions
j01-059-08.png,the +ve nickel conductor with respect
j01-059-09.png,to the sodium by circlips on either side
j01-059-10.png,of the seal I .
j01-063-00.png,Evaporation of sodium from the pool C is
j01-063-01.png,minimised by a close fitting cylindrical
j01-063-02.png,block of electrolyte J attached to the +ve nickel
j01-063-03.png,conductor by nickel circlips . Fixing and
j01-063-04.png,positioning of the probe relative to the coolant
j01-063-05.png,stream is effected by tie-bars of insulating
j01-063-06.png,material K joining the vacuum coupling H to the
j01-063-07.png,water cooled flange G .
j01-066-00.png,The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas
j01-066-01.png,via the tube L which must of course be electrically
j01-066-02.png,isolated after this has been carried out . It is not
j01-066-03.png,suggested that the above proposal will be successful
j01-066-04.png,but rather that it is worth a trial in the event of
j01-066-05.png,the inadequacy of some simpler method of
j01-066-06.png,monitoring the oxygen in a sodium circuit . The
j01-066-07.png,"principal difficulty encountered by the author , in"
j01-066-08.png,determining partial molal free energies by solid
j01-066-09.png,"electrolyte cells of very stable oxides such as UO2 ,"
j01-066-10.png,MnO etc. was vapour phase transfer of oxygen by
j01-066-11.png,carbonaceous impurities in the blanket gas .
j01-070-00.png,This resulted in the oxidation of the
j01-070-01.png,-ve electrode and reduction of the +ve
j01-070-02.png,electrode which of course led to a loss in
j01-070-03.png,E.M.F. from the cell . In the above design the two
j01-070-04.png,electrodes are completely separated from one
j01-070-05.png,another so that this major source of
j01-070-06.png,trouble should not be present .
j04-008-00.png,The presence of 75 of bismuth-210 is equivalent to
j04-008-01.png,ingrowth over two half-lives ( ten days ) . Therefore
j04-008-02.png,"after a further forty days , the bismuth daughter"
j04-008-03.png,will be within 0.1 sources are required for use sooner
j04-008-04.png,"than forty or fifty days after preparation , the"
j04-008-05.png,lead-210 together with added lead carrier must
j04-008-06.png,be separated from the bismuth-210 daughter by
j04-008-07.png,"ion exchange ( see Analytical Method , steps 4 , 5 )"
j04-008-08.png,before precipitating lead chromate .
j04-012-00.png,Knowing the time of separation and the
j04-012-01.png,"activity of the lead-210 solution , the ingrowth"
j04-012-02.png,of the bismuth-210 can be calculated . The
j04-012-03.png,absolute activity of the reference standards
j04-012-04.png,can be calculated from the known activity
j04-012-05.png,of the lead-210 solution and the chemical
j04-012-06.png,"yield , but this calculation is unnecessary"
j04-012-07.png,provided the same lead carrier solution is
j04-012-08.png,used to prepare the reference standards
j04-012-09.png,and for the analyses .
j04-015-00.png,Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate
j04-015-01.png,precipitates need be known because the concentration
j04-015-02.png,of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the
j04-015-03.png,algebraic equations . An effort was made to
j04-015-04.png,detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in
j04-015-05.png,the tracer by separating the lead-210 and the
j04-015-06.png,bismuth-210 by anion exchange . The 15b-counting
j04-015-07.png,of the lead-210 fraction began within a few
j04-015-08.png,minutes of completing the separation .
j04-019-00.png,The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed
j04-019-01.png,for ten days and showed no abnormalities .
j04-019-02.png,Any impurity in the lead fraction must ha-
j04-019-03.png,ve been well below one percent . Some separa-
j04-019-04.png,ted lead-210 was used to make reference stan-
j04-019-05.png,dards and as a tracer in recovery experiments .
j04-019-06.png,There was no significant difference between the-
j04-019-07.png,se results and those obtained using the original
j04-019-08.png,lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical
j04-019-09.png,Centre which we concluded was radiochemi-
j04-019-10.png,cally pure .
j04-024-00.png,Rosenquist ( 4 ) showed that minute quantities of
j04-024-01.png,lead can be isolated from large volumes of solu-
j04-024-02.png,tion by coprecipitating the lead with a strontium
j04-024-03.png,sulphate . Lead and strontium form mixed cry-
j04-024-04.png,stals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate
j04-024-05.png,is almost completely recovered even if precipitation
j04-024-06.png,of the strontium sulphate is incomplete . Using
j04-024-07.png,ten milligrams of lead carrier and six
j04-024-08.png,"hundred milligrams of strontium per liter ,"
j04-024-09.png,more than 95 experiment .
j04-035-00.png,Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a
j04-035-01.png,minimum but the accuracy and precision of
j04-035-02.png,weighing the precipitated sources suffers . All
j04-035-03.png,precipitates were weighed on a semi-micro balance
j04-035-04.png,which had been calibrated with a set of certificated
j04-035-05.png,weights from the National Physical Laboratory .
j04-035-06.png,Complete chemical exchange between the
j04-035-07.png,radio-lead and the added lead carrier is
j04-035-08.png,necessary if the analytical results are to
j04-035-09.png,be correct .
j04-039-00.png,"In the preliminary experiments , the tracer was added to a"
j04-039-01.png,liter of effluent and immediately coprecipitated with
j04-039-02.png,strontium sulphate from hot solution . Chemical exchange
j04-039-03.png,was complete under these conditions ; but when the tracer
j04-039-04.png,was added to alkaline effluent and allowed to
j04-039-05.png,stand for several days before the addition of lead
j04-039-06.png,"carrier , the recovery of lead-210 was as much as five"
j04-039-07.png,per cent low when corrected for gravimetric recovery
j04-039-08.png,of the carrier .
j04-046-00.png,The presence and growth of algae in the
j04-046-01.png,alkaline effluent does not prevent the
j04-046-02.png,recovery of radio-lead under the prescribed
j04-046-03.png,conditions although some radioactivity remains
j04-046-04.png,on the algae until the metathesis has been
j04-046-05.png,completed by heating the mixed sulphates
j04-046-06.png,with three separate portions of dilute ( 1.25
j04-046-07.png,normal ) sodium carbonate solution . The
j04-046-08.png,strength of the carbonate solution was
j04-046-09.png,chosen after experiments with lead tracer
j04-046-10.png,alone which indicated that less lead was
j04-053-00.png,A small manual coffee grinder is useful as the resin
j04-053-01.png,cannot be ground with a mortar and pestle . The
j04-053-02.png,sieved resin is washed repeatedly with distilled water
j04-053-03.png,to remove fines and then with hydrochloric acid to
j04-053-04.png,convert the resin completely to the chloride form .
j04-053-05.png,The 60-100 mesh resin is again washed with water to
j04-053-06.png,remove the acid and finally dried in air .
j04-061-00.png,The glass tube is 11 cm. long and 1 cm. in internal
j04-061-01.png,diameter . One end of the tube is drawn down to a fine
j04-061-02.png,tip and a B14 conical glass socket is fitted to the
j04-061-03.png,other end as shown in Figure 1 . The reservoir is a 50 ml
j04-061-04.png,cylindrical separating funnel with a capillary tap
j04-061-05.png,modified by the addition of a B14 cone to fit the
j04-061-06.png,glass column .
j04-065-00.png,The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by
j04-065-01.png,experiment for each batch of resin using radioactive tracer
j04-065-02.png,"( lead-210 , bismuth-210 ) . A typical elution curve is shown in"
j04-065-03.png,"Figure 3 . Once these volumes have been established , the weight"
j04-065-04.png,of resin used is also fixed . All available evidence indicates
j04-065-05.png,that the fractions containing lead and bismuth are free
j04-065-06.png,of cross contamination apart from the natural
j04-065-07.png,ingrowth of the daughters arising from the decay of
j04-065-08.png,lead .
j04-070-00.png,Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not
j04-070-01.png,interfere . Strontium does not form a chloro-complex
j04-070-02.png,and therefore passes through in the feed solution and
j04-070-03.png,the first wash . The resin is used for a single
j04-070-04.png,separation and then thrown away . In the first stage
j04-070-05.png,"of the analysis , only the fraction containing"
j04-070-06.png,lead-210 is collected . The lead is precipitated as
j04-070-07.png,"the chromate , washed , slurried onto an aluminium"
j04-070-08.png,"counting tray , dried under an infra-red lamp ,"
j04-070-09.png,"weighed , and set aside for five days while the"
j04-070-10.png,bismuth-210 grows in .
j04-076-00.png,"At the end of five days , bismuth-210 will have"
j04-076-01.png,reached one-half of its equilibrium value and
j04-076-02.png,can be counted through an aluminium absorber
j04-076-03.png,sufficiently thick to stop the beta particles
j04-076-04.png,from lead-210 and the alpha particles from
j04-076-05.png,polonium-210 .
j04-080-00.png,During the first few hours the curve will be
j04-080-01.png,distorted if activity other than bismuth-
j04-080-02.png,210 is present . These bismuth nuclides may
j04-080-03.png,include : together with their lead parents .
j04-080-04.png,All but lead-212 will decay completely
j04-080-05.png,within six hours . The decay of lead-212
j04-080-06.png,will distort the observed activity for
j04-080-07.png,hour and a half days if it is
j04-080-08.png,present .
j04-094-00.png,"If there is sufficient beta activity , the radioche-"
j04-094-01.png,mical purity of the Bi-210 may be checked
j04-094-02.png,by observing the decay curve . The removal of lead
j04-094-03.png,chromate from the aluminium counting tray together
j04-094-04.png,with the bismuth-210 prior to the second ion
j04-094-05.png,exchange separation has been checked by
j04-094-06.png,counting the trays . Not more than 0.2 of the
j04-094-07.png,bismuth-210 remains on the tray after the
j04-094-08.png,acid wash .
j04-098-00.png,This loss is acceptably small for an analytical
j04-098-01.png,step when no correction for carrier
j04-098-02.png,recovery is possible . The completeness
j04-098-03.png,of the chemical exchange between the
j04-098-04.png,bismuth-210 and the added carrier was
j04-098-05.png,also tested . Two samples of precipitated
j04-098-06.png,"lead chromate ( lead-210 , bismuth-210 )"
j04-098-07.png,were counted and dissolved in nitric
j04-098-08.png,acid in silica basins . The contents
j04-098-09.png,were evaporated to dryness with
j04-098-10.png,bismuth carrier and then taken up in
j04-103-00.png,The bismuth was recovered from the eluate as the
j04-103-01.png,phosphate . Results did not differ from those obtained by the more
j04-103-02.png,convenient method of heating the dissolved chro-
j04-103-03.png,mates in 2 N hydrochloric acid for fifteen minutes . The more
j04-103-04.png,rigorous method of securing chemical exchange was unnecessary .
j04-103-05.png,Lead-210 when present in effluent is likely to be found
j04-103-06.png,only at very low concentrations .
j04-111-00.png,Table 1 shows the decontamination factors
j04-111-01.png,"obtained experimentally for ten radionuclides ,"
j04-111-02.png,accompanied in two instances by radioactive dau-
j04-111-03.png,ghters . The decontamination factor falls below
j04-111-04.png,104 only for Ruthenium-106 and zirconium-95
j04-111-05.png,"with their daughters in the first stage , i.e."
j04-111-06.png,the lead chromate source containing the bismuth-
j04-111-07.png,21 daughter . When the second stage ( the bismuth
j04-111-08.png,"phosphate source ) is completed , the decontami-"
j04-111-09.png,nation factors are exceptionally high .
j04-115-00.png,A known quantity ( approx. 1 x 10-2 15mc ) of
j04-115-01.png,lead-210 was added to 1-litre aliquots
j04-115-02.png,of different batches of typical low-activity
j04-115-03.png,effluent . The aliquots were allowed to
j04-115-04.png,stand for about seven days ( except
j04-115-05.png,where noted to the contrary ) before lead
j04-115-06.png,carrier was added and the analytical
j04-115-07.png,procedure begun .
j06-000-00.png,"All stages of Calanus , for example ,"
j06-000-01.png,seem to migrate on some occasions while
j06-000-02.png,any stage may not on others . Such data
j06-000-03.png,cannot yet be rationalized . Where
j06-000-04.png,"information is less extensive , however , it is"
j06-000-05.png,possible to find some regularity in the
j06-000-06.png,observations . Thus in Euphausia superba
j06-000-07.png,"from the Antarctic , the metanauplii remain"
j06-000-08.png,"in deep water , the later larval stages"
j06-000-09.png,"migrate diurnally , and the adolescents"
j06-000-10.png,stay permanently at the surface .
j06-005-00.png,The migrating stages all come from 100-250
j06-005-01.png,"meters , and the time of their arrival at"
j06-005-02.png,the surface is directly related to their
j06-005-03.png,swimming capacity : 3rd ( oldest )
j06-005-04.png,"calyptopis from 1800-2200 hr ; 2nd ,"
j06-005-05.png,"from 2200-0200 hr ; and 1st , from 0200-0600 hr ."
j06-005-06.png,Similar ontogenetic differences are apparent
j06-005-07.png,in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain
j06-005-08.png,at the surface while the young migrate
j06-005-09.png,to and from a depth of 50 meters .
j06-008-00.png,Such permanent occurrence at the surface
j06-008-01.png,could of course be considered the extreme
j06-008-02.png,of a variable day depth . The effect of
j06-008-03.png,day depths upon the surfacing of various
j06-008-04.png,animals has been reviewed elsewhere . c .
j06-008-05.png,Anomalies . In spite of the variability
j06-008-06.png,"of migrational behavior , some kinds"
j06-008-07.png,of anomalies may be recognized .
j06-008-08.png,Vertical movement occurs in some forms
j06-008-09.png,apparently in the reverse manner to
j06-008-10.png,that commonly met .
j06-014-00.png,Such reversed migrations are known for

j06-014-07.png,"of euphausiids , has also been described"
j06-014-08.png,"as , in part , regularly moving in a reverse"
j06-014-09.png,manner . Most of these records are well
j06-014-10.png,substantiated and involve whole populations
j06-014-11.png,rather than aberrant individuals .
j06-018-00.png,But normal movements have been
j06-018-01.png,reported also for the same species in
j06-018-02.png,the case of five of these examples
j06-018-03.png,and for other species in the same
j06-018-04.png,"genera for the remaining Evadne ,"
j06-018-05.png,"Daphnia , and Diaptomus . Many"
j06-018-06.png,forms sometimes migrate and on other
j06-018-07.png,"occasions do not , but a few"
j06-018-08.png,appear to remain permanently at
j06-018-09.png,one level . Considering the widespread
j06-018-10.png,incidence of migration in the
j06-022-00.png,The most clearly substantiated case
j06-022-01.png,is that of the copepod Anomalocera
j06-022-02.png,"patersoni , which remains permanently"
j06-022-03.png,at the surface . Among other copepods
j06-022-04.png,"Rhincalanus gigas , Calanoides acutus ,"
j06-022-05.png,"Microcalanus pygmaeus , Oithona"
j06-022-06.png,"frigida , and Centropages typicus are"
j06-022-07.png,reported as showing no migration .
j06-022-08.png,The predaceous cladoceran Bythotrephes
j06-022-09.png,longimanus also remains at one
j06-022-10.png,"level , about 10 meters down ."
j06-026-00.png,In view of its well-known normal
j06-026-01.png,"migration , the occurrence of Calanus"
j06-026-02.png,finmarchicus in the summer at
j06-026-03.png,the surface in bright sunlight
j06-026-04.png,may justly be considered anomalous .
j06-026-05.png,This phenomenon has nevertheless been
j06-026-06.png,"recorded many times , and such"
j06-026-07.png,surface Calanus may be present in
j06-026-08.png,"enormous numbers , breaking the surface"
j06-026-09.png,into small circular ripples like
j06-030-00.png,It seems likely that a continuous
j06-030-01.png,interchange was taking place between
j06-030-02.png,the population at the surface and
j06-030-03.png,that in deeper water . A second
j06-030-04.png,group whose normal vertical
j06-030-05.png,migration is sufficiently well
j06-030-06.png,known to make daytime
j06-030-07.png,occurrence at the surface
j06-030-08.png,rank as anomalous is the
j06-030-09.png,Euphausiacea . There are numerous
j06-030-10.png,records of euphausiids swimming
j06-034-00.png,2 . Mechanisms . The majority of
j06-034-01.png,vertical migrations undoubtedly
j06-034-02.png,result from active swimming
j06-034-03.png,although passive movement through
j06-034-04.png,the water has been suggested on
j06-034-05.png,"various grounds . For example ,"
j06-034-06.png,transport in vertical currents
j06-034-07.png,resulting from temperature diff-
j06-034-08.png,erences has been proposed ; diff-
j06-034-09.png,erences in water viscosity after
j06-034-10.png,temperature changes have also been
j06-051-00.png,Downward movement may in some forms
j06-051-01.png,"start as a passive sinking , especially"
j06-051-02.png,when it occurs before dawn ; but this
j06-051-03.png,must almost certainly be replaced
j06-051-04.png,by the headfirst downward swimming
j06-051-05.png,"observed in the field . 3 . Initiating ,"
j06-051-06.png,"controlling , and orienting factors . The"
j06-051-07.png,primary dependence of diurnal
j06-051-08.png,migrations upon changes in light intensity
j06-051-09.png,is beyond doubt . Yet in spite
j06-051-10.png,"of a great amount of work ,"
j06-056-00.png,Loeb first suggested the importance
j06-056-01.png,of light as the governing factor
j06-056-02.png,but combined its influence with that
j06-056-03.png,"of gravity . Later authors , in particular"
j06-056-04.png,"Rose , have proposed that light"
j06-056-05.png,alone can provide an adequate
j06-056-06.png,"mechanism if the animals have ,"
j06-056-07.png,"and select by exploration , a"
j06-056-08.png,zone of optimum light intensity .
j06-056-09.png,This view has been enlarged
j06-056-10.png,with a suggestion that both
j07-000-00.png,This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be
j07-000-01.png,obtained with tubular constructions . The growth of the
j07-000-02.png,aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need
j07-000-03.png,"for lightweight compact heat exchangers . During the 1930's ,"
j07-000-04.png,the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction
j07-000-05.png,"became established for aero-engine radiators , using"
j07-000-06.png,dip-soldered copper . The air and engine-coolant passages
j07-000-07.png,were separated by flat plates .
j07-005-00.png,The air passages were packed with corrugated
j07-005-01.png,foil bonded to the primary plates to
j07-005-02.png,provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer .
j07-005-03.png,"The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil ,"
j07-005-04.png,chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand
j07-005-05.png,the coolant pressure loadings . The introduction of the aluminium alloy
j07-005-06.png,dip-brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up
j07-005-07.png,for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial
j07-005-08.png,weight reductions as compared with copper construction .
j07-009-00.png,This development coincided with the introduction of
j07-009-01.png,pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air
j07-009-02.png,cabin coolers . Although in this case the heat transfer
j07-009-03.png,coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger
j07-009-04.png,"were of comparable magnitude , the use of"
j07-009-05.png,"secondary surface was still attractive , since the"
j07-009-06.png,greater part of the surface area could be made up
j07-009-07.png,of fins only 0.006 in. ( 0.15 mm. ) thick .
j07-012-00.png,"Furthermore , developments in the detail form of"
j07-012-01.png,the fins made possible a reduction in the total
j07-012-02.png,surface area required as compared with the use of
j07-012-03.png,smooth continuous passages for the same thermal
j07-012-04.png,duty and pressure losses . The properties of
j07-012-05.png,"compact form , low weight , and design flexibility"
j07-012-06.png,thus developed found ready application on a
j07-012-07.png,much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage
j07-012-08.png,scale air separation plants .
j07-015-00.png,The basic method of construction is both simple and
j07-015-01.png,extremely flexible . Figure 3 illustrates the
j07-015-02.png,arrangement of a single passage . This can be
j07-015-03.png,extended in length and width up to the limit of
j07-015-04.png,manufacturing equipment available . The corrugation
j07-015-05.png,"is machine-formed , thus ensuring a high standard"
j07-015-06.png,of uniformity in height and fin pitch .
k01-051-00.png,"Though that was not quite the phrase , for even"
k01-051-01.png,"if he could succeed Sir Charles he would , as"
k01-051-02.png,"an executive , be eternally differentiated from"

k01-051-05.png,"cleverer than most , discreetly used their Christian"
k01-051-06.png,names - but remained their servant . They had
k01-051-07.png,"no office hours , however elastic ; their lives were"
k01-051-08.png,spent in committee making decisions for others
k01-051-09.png,to execute on the basis of data laboriously
k02-018-00.png,"The gin pahits , and now the beer with the"
k02-018-01.png,"curry , had their desired effect on us ;"
k02-018-02.png,"or rather , on Nigel and myself . Lee , I"
k02-018-03.png,"noticed , had asked for Coca-Cola . This"
k02-018-04.png,rather surprised me from a young man
k02-018-05.png,who was otherwise so sophisticated . He
k02-018-06.png,"was not , however , ostentatious about"
k02-018-07.png,the matter .
k02-023-00.png,"If anything , he had merely become a little more reserved , and"
k02-023-01.png,much more polite . I thought to myself : ' A few years in the
k02-023-02.png,"East , my boy , and you 'll drink - I 've seen your kind be-"
k02-023-03.png,"fore ! ' After the curry , I wanted only to go upstairs to"
k02-023-04.png,"bed . I had long since become accustomed , and now addicted ,"
k02-023-05.png,to an after-curry nap .
k02-023-06.png,Verena Holenstein
k02-029-00.png,"Lee , however , showed not the slightest sign of fatigue . ' I"
k02-029-01.png,"wonder if you 'd mind if I took a bit of a look round , '"
k02-029-02.png,"he asked Nigel . ' I don't sleep in the afternoons . ' Nigel ,"
k02-029-03.png,"I must say , was very good about it . I knew how much"
k02-029-04.png,"he probably wanted to sleep himself . But , almost"
k02-029-05.png,"gallantly , he said :"
k02-036-00.png,"' Not at all . I 'll show you . ' ' Oh no , '"
k02-036-01.png,"young Lee protested , considerate as always ."
k02-036-02.png,"' That 's not necessary if you want to rest , sir ."
k02-036-03.png,I 'm sure I won't do any harm . ' Nigel
k02-036-04.png,laughed . I had not known he was so
k02-036-05.png,"good-natured . But then , I suppose I had"
k02-036-06.png,never given him similar cause to display
k02-036-07.png,such amiability .
k02-053-00.png,"I slept soundly , and much later than I should . It"
k02-053-01.png,"was already after six when I awoke , and the sun"
k02-053-02.png,was nearly setting beyond the west window .
k02-053-03.png,"Downstairs I could hear the murmur of voices ,"
k02-053-04.png,"and knew they were back . I wondered , as I"
k02-053-05.png,"wrapped a 6sarong around my waist , if"
k02-053-06.png,Nigel at all resented being deprived of his
k02-053-07.png,afternoon sleep .
k02-062-00.png,"And I said to myself : Oh , God , doesn't the"
k02-062-01.png,boy ever relax ! He turned his gaze away
k02-062-02.png,"from me almost instantly , but it had"
k02-062-03.png,been enough to make me conscious of the
k02-062-04.png,"nakedness of the upper half of my body , even"
k02-062-05.png,of the matted grey hairs on my chest . He
k02-062-06.png,probably thought my appearance quite a breach
k02-062-07.png,"of the social graces ; but , naturally , he said"
k02-062-08.png,not so much as a word about it .
k02-067-00.png,"' We 've just had tea , ' Nigel said . ' Would you like"
k02-067-01.png,the cookie to make you a fresh lot ? ' ' I 'd rather
k02-067-02.png,"have whisky , ' I told him . ' Thought as much ."
k02-067-03.png,"Sun 's nearly below the yard-arm , anyway ."
k02-067-04.png,Wouldn't mind a stengah myself . How about
k02-067-05.png,"you , Harry ? ' So they had managed to come"
k02-067-06.png,to the stage of using each other's Christian
k02-067-07.png,"names , I noted ."
k02-076-00.png,Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as
k02-076-01.png,"reserved as I thought . ' Thanks ,"
k02-076-02.png,"Nigel , ' he said . ' Just Coca-Cola ."
k02-076-03.png,Although I 'd like to have
k02-076-04.png,whatever you have . I want to
k02-076-05.png,get to know the kind of life
k02-076-06.png,"people lead in the East , you know . '"
k02-076-07.png,"At this , I felt a return of the"
k02-076-08.png,irritation I felt with him
k02-076-09.png,at times .
k02-093-00.png,"Knowing Nigel , I would have been surprised if he"
k02-093-01.png,had not made his usual ' arrangements ' . A bachelor
k02-093-02.png,"himself , he knew well how to entertain his bachelor"
k02-093-03.png,friends . He caught my look and pursed his lips in
k02-093-04.png,a quick little grimace of acknowledgement ; then raised
k02-093-05.png,an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's direction .
k02-097-00.png,I shrugged a shoulder . Lee would have
k02-097-01.png,"to decide about that for himself , I"
k02-097-02.png,"thought , and noticed that although he"
k02-097-03.png,"was looking at the other girl , he did"
k02-097-04.png,"so quite dispassionately , almost as though"
k02-097-05.png,he was merely interested in the unfamiliar
k02-097-06.png,clothes she was wearing . And I thought
k02-097-07.png,to myself : He may be still too much of
k02-097-08.png,a ' new chum ' to see ' the beauty of
k02-097-09.png,the East ' .
k02-102-00.png,"There was still an ease in our conversation , but its"
k02-102-01.png,scope was restricted . I felt that I could hardly make the
k02-102-02.png,usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses
k02-102-03.png,"as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him , much as I"
k02-102-04.png,wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment .
k02-102-05.png,"And I suppose he felt the same . We had only a few drinks ,"
k02-102-06.png,then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
k02-102-07.png,dinner .
k02-112-00.png,He had one of the better Kashmir carpets on
k02-112-01.png,"the floor . His pictures and curtains , indeed I"
k02-112-02.png,"suppose the entire furnishings , had been se-"
k02-112-03.png,"lected personally . The house was , as he"
k02-112-04.png,"occasionally proclaimed , his home - and he had"
k02-112-05.png,made it as such . I doubt if he will ever
k02-112-06.png,"leave Malaya , even when he retires ."
k02-117-00.png,"The country , and his mistresses , have come"
k02-117-01.png,"to mean too much to him . And , indirectly ,"
k02-117-02.png,this impression I had of him was one of several
k02-117-03.png,reasons why I had decided I should leave
k02-117-04.png,"it - before , for me too , it would be too late ."
k02-117-05.png,I used the excuse of our early start in the
k02-117-06.png,morning to retire as soon as it seemed
k02-117-07.png,"prudent to do so , after the coffee and brandy ,"
k02-117-08.png,already anticipating the familiar pleasures
k02-117-09.png,awaiting me .
k03-117-00.png,After lunch two of the Prime Minister's
k03-117-01.png,"grandchildren who had sat , rather intimidated"
k03-117-02.png,by Ormston and staring at the Grinling
k03-117-03.png,"Gibbons carving around the fireplace , rose"
k03-117-04.png,"gratefully from the table , leaving the two"
k03-117-05.png,"men together . A nurse came in , and asked"
k03-117-06.png,the Prime Minister if he wanted to be
k03-117-07.png,"helped out on to the lawn , but he waved"
k03-117-08.png,her away impatiently .
k03-138-00.png,I don't mean just our direct military costs . I 'm
k03-138-01.png,thinking of the African Boycott which is already working up .
k03-138-02.png,"I 'm afraid , Prime Minister , you 're not going to like the"
k03-138-03.png,"trading position when you see it . ' ' I never do , ' the"
k03-138-04.png,Prime Minister commented wearily . The Chancellor
k03-138-05.png,was repeating an argument which he had already
k03-138-06.png,developed for an hour before lunch .
k03-144-00.png,"' It comes at a bad time , ' said"
k03-144-01.png,Ormston . ' A singularly bad time . The
k03-144-02.png,"Party 's very restless , you know . ' ' It"
k03-144-03.png,is a sign of life - very encouraging ! '
k03-144-04.png,' The younger men - ' ' Which ones ? '
k03-144-05.png,"' The younger ones like Gore , Vaughan ,"
k03-144-06.png,"Hadley , Prebble , Lambert-Price - the"
k03-144-07.png,New Africa lot - ' ' Do they confide
k03-144-08.png,in you ? Have you spoken to them ? '
k03-152-00.png,"' Only at yesterday's meeting - they 're very restless , Prime"
k03-152-01.png,Minister . They feel that it 's very old-fashioned - shooting
k03-152-02.png,down mobs of natives . They 're very much afraid that
k03-152-03.png,if the Opposition get a Commission of Enquiry some
k03-152-04.png,rather dismal stuff is going to come out . '
k03-152-05.png,' Young back-benchers are always restive when they 're
k03-152-06.png,"bored , ' said the Prime Minister , and for the first"
k03-152-07.png,"time since his grandchildren left the table , he smiled ."
k03-157-00.png,' Why don't you give them something to play with ? '
k03-157-01.png,"' They 've found their own toy , ' said Ormston ,"
k03-157-02.png,' and this is it . They want to abstain next week . '
k03-157-03.png,The Prime Minister continued in his flippant
k03-157-04.png,"tone , ' Tell the Chief to give them a"
k03-157-05.png,"talking-to . ' The Chancellor closed his eyes ,"
k03-157-06.png,"and then said ,"
k03-164-00.png,"' I think it 's gone beyond that , Prime Minister ."
k03-164-01.png,They feel pretty strongly about Africa . They are greatly
k03-164-02.png,disturbed by the new and rather ugly image of
k03-164-03.png,the Party which our African policy is creating .
k03-164-04.png,"On the whole , the country is still in favour"
k03-164-05.png,of moderation and common sense . Melville has
k03-164-06.png,in a curious way made us look old-fashioned
k03-164-07.png,- extravagant - nineteenth centuryish -
k03-164-08.png,almost cranky . '
k03-180-00.png,"The Prime Minister looked puzzled , and said , ' Julia Drayford ? How"
k03-180-01.png,does she come into it ? I can't follow these complexities - ' ' It isn't
k03-180-02.png,quite that . The whole business blew up from Melville's disgraceful
k03-180-03.png,indiscretion to Julia Drayford in Mrs. M'landa's presence .
k03-180-04.png,I don't know the exact chain of gossip or who told who
k03-180-05.png,what .
k04-000-00.png,"As he turned aside his head , since he could not"
k04-000-01.png,"bear to look at her beautiful , pleading face , he was"
k04-000-02.png,suddenly attacked by suspicion . ' You wish to marry
k04-000-03.png,someone else ! ' he cried in a voice roughened by
k04-000-04.png,"jealousy . She sighed deeply , and looked away . ' Do you ?"
k04-000-05.png,"Do you ? ' he repeated , fiercely ."
k04-005-00.png,"' If , ' she said gently , giving him a look that set his pulses throbbing ,"
k04-005-01.png,"' if I wished to marry some young gallant , do you think I would"
k04-005-02.png,ask your help ? You would be the last man I would ask . ' Before
k04-005-03.png,"he could collect his wits to reply to this , there was a bustle"
k04-005-04.png,and confusion at the end of the room . Prince Doria had
k04-005-05.png,wearied of his toy and was packing it away in its painted
k04-005-06.png,coffer .
k04-010-00.png,The party was now preparing to see
k04-010-01.png,"the tapestries , and in the general"
k04-010-02.png,"movement , Vittoria was separated from"
k04-010-03.png,Orsini . Although neither of them
k04-010-04.png,"wished to follow the sightseers , there seemed"
k04-010-05.png,no alternative . As she was about to mount
k04-010-06.png,a wide and shallow flight of marble
k04-010-07.png,"stairs , she became aware of someone"
k04-010-08.png,"watching her intently , and turning"
k04-010-09.png,"in that direction , she saw Olimpia ,"
k04-010-10.png,"standing beside her admirer , Orlando Cavalcanti ."
k04-014-00.png,The young man was bending over her with the
k04-014-01.png,"assiduity of a lover , but the girl appeared to be more"
k04-014-02.png,"interested in her cousin's wife , whom she was regarding"
k04-014-03.png,through half-closed eyes . This was a slight shock to
k04-014-04.png,"Vittoria , who had forgotten the existence of the girl ,"
k04-014-05.png,"and , up to this moment had been unaware of the"
k04-014-06.png,young man's presence at the palazzo .
k04-017-00.png,"' Are you enjoying yourself , Olimpia ? ' she"
k04-017-01.png,"asked idly , tapping the girl's cheek lightly with"
k04-017-02.png,"her fan , in passing ; but she did not wait for"
k04-017-03.png,"the answer . Disturbed by vague uneasiness , she"
k04-017-04.png,was wondering whether Olimpia had been
k04-017-05.png,watching her talk with Orsini . Surely she
k04-017-06.png,could not have overheard anything they
k04-017-07.png,said ? A moment's reflection reassured her
k04-017-08.png,"on that point , for she was certain no one"
k04-017-09.png,had been standing near them .
k04-022-00.png,"However , something inimical in the girl's look"
k04-022-01.png,put Vittoria on guard . ' Santa Maria ! These spying
k04-022-02.png,"eyes ! ' she thought , bitterly . Doria was continually"
k04-022-03.png,"stopping on the way , to point out , with childish pride ,"
k04-022-04.png,"objects of beauty or interest . Vittoria , on the"
k04-022-05.png,"fringe of the party , caught snatches of this"
k04-022-06.png,"information , which held no interest for her :"
k04-022-07.png,' ... now this sapphire ...
k04-028-00.png,I like to think it may have fallen from the dark
k04-028-01.png,"hair of the Empress Messalina , as she crouched"
k04-028-02.png,"in terror in the gardens of Lucullus , awaiting the"
k04-028-03.png,sword of the executioner . ' ' Ah ! ' exclaimed
k04-028-04.png,"Farnese , with a snigger . ' The old cuckold"
k04-028-05.png,"Claudius had the last word , after all . He"
k04-028-06.png,"knew how to deal with an adulterous wife ,"
k04-028-07.png,"eh , Orsini ? '"
k04-033-00.png,"If the duke made any reply to this , Vittoria did"
k04-033-01.png,not hear it . Now they entered the long gallery
k04-033-02.png,"where they dispersed and wandered around , admiring"
k04-033-03.png,and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric
k04-033-04.png,splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought
k04-033-05.png,"back from Lepanto . After a short interval , Orsini"
k04-033-06.png,found an opportunity to rejoin Vittoria .
k04-033-07.png,"' We must talk further , ' he said in a low"
k04-033-08.png,urgent voice . ' Where ? '
k04-039-00.png,"' Be careful , ' she whispered from behind her fan ."
k04-039-01.png,' Olimpia is watching us . The young man with her is
k04-039-02.png,"Orlando Cavalcanti , Francesco's friend . ' Orsini"
k04-039-03.png,shot an impatient glance at the couple . ' The young man
k04-039-04.png,"with the mole ? ' ' Yes , indeed . ' ' No matter . They are not"
k04-039-05.png,"looking at us . Now I must know , ' he whispered , ' what"
k04-039-06.png,"you meant , cara mia . Do you want your freedom in order"
k04-039-07.png,to marry ? '
k04-050-00.png,"Before replying to this , she glanced"
k04-050-01.png,"hastily around , then spoke in tones so low that he"
k04-050-02.png,had to bend his head to hear : ' I will never be
k04-050-03.png,any man's mistress . As to marrying again ...
k04-050-04.png,if I were free ... there is only one man I would
k04-050-05.png,"wish to marry ... but ... he , like myself , is now"
k04-050-06.png,bound . '
k04-054-00.png,With a swift gesture she closed her fan
k04-054-01.png,and moved away from him towards the group
k04-054-02.png,"in the centre of the gallery , leaving him standing"
k04-054-03.png,"alone , against that glowing , barbaric background ,"
k04-054-04.png,with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face .
k04-054-05.png,On a bright unclouded morning a few days after
k04-054-06.png,"the visit to the Doria Palace , the cardinal's"
k04-054-07.png,"coach left the villa , lurched over the unpaved"
k04-054-08.png,track and turned towards the ruined Baths
k04-054-09.png,of Diocletian .
k04-057-00.png,"Vittoria , accompanied by her maid , Lucia , was on her"
k04-057-01.png,"way to the Accoramboni villa , ostensibly to pay"
k04-057-02.png,"a daughterly call on her father , actually to coax"
k04-057-03.png,money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting
k04-057-04.png,debts . Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress
k04-057-05.png,"looked , and how cunningly the olive-green dress"
k04-057-06.png,with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her
k04-057-07.png,perfect figure . Vittoria's thoughts were more complex .
k04-061-00.png,"The sparkling society of the Doria Palace , the flattery"
k04-061-01.png,"of Orsini's obsession , the thwarted ambitions of her"
k04-061-02.png,"restless spirit , all threw into sharp relief the contrast"
k04-061-03.png,of her grey life with the splendid one that filled
k04-061-04.png,"her dreams . At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien ,"
k04-061-05.png,and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco
k04-061-06.png,"to give her a separate establishment , he invariably"
k04-061-07.png,"pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle , who"
k04-061-08.png,had built the villa for his family .
k04-064-00.png,He reminded her that they must abide by Roman
k04-064-01.png,"custom , and dwell there with their relations . Her"
k04-064-02.png,values were those of the materialist who assesses
k04-064-03.png,"every human being in terms of fame , power and"
k04-064-04.png,"wealth . Francesco she despised for his dullness , his"
k04-064-05.png,"lack of initiative , his subservience to his uncle ."
k04-068-00.png,"Her husband's gentleness and amiability , his unselfish"
k04-068-01.png,"love for her , she regarded as signs of weakness . He was a"
k04-068-02.png,futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
k04-068-03.png,her a child . Whatever passion she had experienced in the
k04-068-04.png,first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt .
k04-068-05.png,She had never loved him . Her thoughts rushed to Orsini .
k04-068-06.png,"Since the meeting in the Doria Palace , no word had"
k04-068-07.png,"come from him , and this silence oppressed her spirits"
k04-068-08.png,with a weight of misgiving .
k04-075-00.png,"She had , perhaps , demanded too much . The"
k04-075-01.png,kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus-
k04-075-02.png,"pected depths in her , and she knew that"
k04-075-03.png,"if she yielded to him , her passion could ,"
k04-075-04.png,"indeed , match his . Every instinct urged her to"
k04-075-05.png,"surrender , for there was that in his nature"
k04-075-06.png,to which her own had responded as it
k04-075-07.png,had responded to no other human being .
k04-079-00.png,"Prudence , ambition and reason had"
k04-079-01.png,"held instinct in check , and they must"
k04-079-02.png,dictate her course . There could be no
k04-079-03.png,compromise . For a brief interval
k04-079-04.png,she allowed herself the luxury of
k04-079-05.png,dreams . She began to imagine life at
k04-079-06.png,"Bracciano , the balls and fe*?5tes , the"
k04-079-07.png,conversation of poets and dilettanti . She
k04-079-08.png,visualized the pageantry of the tourna-
k04-079-09.png,"ment , and herself on the ducal dais beside"
k04-079-10.png,"Orsini , placing a chaplet of roses on the brows"
k04-085-00.png,This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a
k04-085-01.png,"sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop , nearly throwing"
k04-085-02.png,the two girls from their seats . Lucia uttered a cry of
k04-085-03.png,"alarm . ' Look , madonna , we are surrounded ! ' It was true ."
k04-085-04.png,Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about
k04-085-05.png,"them and a lean , swarthy fellow was peering through"
k04-085-06.png,"the window , grinning impudently . ' Santa Maria ! '"
k04-085-07.png,shrieked Lucia . ' Banditti ! '
k04-093-00.png,Vittoria now realized that they were outside
k04-093-01.png,"Santa Maria degli Angeli , and that except for a few beggars"
k04-093-02.png,crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting
k04-093-03.png,"loathsome sores , the area was deserted . ' They are not banditti ,"
k04-093-04.png,"Lucia , ' said Vittoria , pointing to the badge on the man's"
k04-093-05.png,shoulder . The words were clear . ' Beware my hug ! ' Lucia
k04-093-06.png,stared speechlessly at the golden bear ; Vittoria swiftly
k04-093-07.png,averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance
k04-093-08.png,of the retainer .
k04-099-00.png,Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic . The
k04-099-01.png,"coach now turned in another direction , towards"
k04-099-02.png,the wild and desolate region behind the baths .
k04-099-03.png,"It was sparsely inhabited , dotted with fallow fields"
k04-099-04.png,"and terraced vineyards , and here and there jutted"
k04-099-05.png,"a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins , a pathetic"
k04-099-06.png,reminder of Rome's former greatness .
k04-103-00.png,In this region of Monti most of the public baths
k04-103-01.png,"had been built in the time of the Caesars , but with the"
k04-103-02.png,breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
k04-103-03.png,the baths had lost their purpose ; they had become
k04-103-04.png,stone quarries and their precious marble had been
k04-103-05.png,burnt for lime . Now escaped criminals and bandits
k04-103-06.png,"used these quarries as hiding places , to the danger"
k04-103-07.png,of travellers in the district .
k04-106-00.png,"As they lumbered past at a rattling pace , Vittoria"
k04-106-01.png,could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a
k04-106-02.png,gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures
k04-106-03.png,"gathered about it , cooking their frugal meal . These"
k04-106-04.png,were left far behind . An old man belabouring an
k04-106-05.png,"overladen donkey , and a withered crone appeared"
k04-106-06.png,"on the horizon , were overtaken and forgotten ."
k04-110-00.png,"Except for their escort , Vittoria and"
k04-110-01.png,Lucia might have been the only living
k04-110-02.png,creatures on an empty planet . After the
k04-110-03.png,"initial shock , Vittoria felt calm . She"
k04-110-04.png,"knew exactly what she wanted , and"
k04-110-05.png,"was prepared to take it without scruple ,"
k04-110-06.png,if she could . What she had forgotten
k04-110-07.png,in her self-absorption in her own schemes
k04-110-08.png,was that other people were equally absorbed
k04-110-09.png,"in their schemes , which were likely to"
k04-110-10.png,run counter to her own .
k04-115-00.png,This move today was a reminder of that fact .
k04-115-01.png,Whilst she automatically patted the hand of
k04-115-02.png,"the agitated Lucia , her brain was working"
k04-115-03.png,"rapidly , and she decided that she must be"
k04-115-04.png,"prepared to counter Orsini's demands ,"
k04-115-05.png,difficult though that would be . She became
k04-115-06.png,aware that the pace was slackening ;
k04-115-07.png,now the coach stopped .
k04-119-00.png,The moment had come . Upon the ensuing interview
k04-119-01.png,"the future would depend . Outwardly she was calm , but"
k04-119-02.png,"her heart was beating fast , and the palms of her"
k04-119-03.png,hands were damp . Orsini's high-crowned hat with
k04-119-04.png,its jaunty plume blotted out the light ; his hand
k04-119-05.png,was on the door . Glancing at Lucia he said in
k04-119-06.png,French to Vittoria : ' Your maid ... is she reliable ? '
k04-126-00.png,"She shrugged her shoulders , and replied in the same"
k04-126-01.png,language : ' Yes . But make it worth her while . '
k04-126-02.png,"' I see . I know how to deal with people like that , '"
k04-126-03.png,"and turning to the cowering Lucia , he spoke in her"
k04-126-04.png,"own language . ' Do you know who I am ? ' ' No ,"
k04-126-05.png,"signor , ' she whispered . ' I am the Orsini . My word is"
k04-126-06.png,law in Rome . '
k04-136-00.png,Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat .
k04-136-01.png,"Thrusting his head farther into the coach , he said"
k04-136-02.png,sombrely : ' Have you ever heard of a punishment called
k04-136-03.png,the cord ? ' She blanched and shrank away . Was there not
k04-136-04.png,a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda
k04-136-05.png,"where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty , fifty ,"
k04-136-06.png,"sixty feet into the air , and dropped again and again , until"
k04-136-07.png,their arms were wrenched from their sockets . ' You have
k04-136-08.png,heard of it ?
k04-142-00.png,The Orsini give that to traitors . There is
k04-142-01.png,no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini . We hunt
k04-142-02.png,"a traitor down to the ends of the earth , and no"
k04-142-03.png,power can save him ... or her . Do you understand ? '
k04-142-04.png,"' Yes , signor , ' she faltered . ' On the other hand , ' he"
k04-142-05.png,"continued , giving her a keen look , ' the Orsini are"
k04-142-06.png,generous to those who serve them faithfully .
k04-149-00.png,"Remember that , my girl . ' Lucia was beyond"
k04-149-01.png,"speech . He turned to Vittoria , sitting erect ,"
k04-149-02.png,with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with
k04-149-03.png,"anger . ' And now , madonna , ' he said smoothly , ' we will"
k04-149-04.png,continue the conversation started at the Doria
k04-149-05.png,"Palace . Be pleased to alight . ' ' I think , ' she replied"
k04-149-06.png,"coolly , ' I prefer to stay where I am . '"
k04-156-00.png,"' In that case , ' he reverted to French , ' I shall be obliged"
k04-156-01.png,"to lift you from the coach . ' Without answering him , she"
k04-156-02.png,"rose , and bending over the agitated girl , said softly :"
k04-156-03.png,"' No one will harm you , Lucia . Remain here . ' Ignoring his"
k04-156-04.png,"proffered hand , she stepped from the vehicle . ' Will you"
k04-156-05.png,be so good as to order your men not to molest my
k04-156-06.png,"maid , ' she said coldly to Orsini ."
k04-163-00.png,"' She is absolutely safe , ' he replied ; but he turned ,"
k04-163-01.png,"nevertheless , to the man who had peered into the"
k04-163-02.png,"coach , whom he had addressed as Luigi , and gave him sharp"
k04-163-03.png,"instructions on the matter . Vittoria stood looking about her ,"
k04-163-04.png,breathing the scent of thyme . The land at her feet sloped
k04-163-05.png,"away into a tiny valley beyond which , on the crest"
k04-163-06.png,"of a wooded hill-side , the ruins of a small temple"
k04-163-07.png,were etched against the clear blue of the sky .
k07-059a-00.png,"He forgot time and place . He , the master , was gently"
k07-059a-01.png,"led along erotic paths which he knew existed , but"
k07-059a-02.png,had never trodden . He learned how to use his
k07-059a-03.png,"hands , how to adore that body without haste , how"
k07-059a-04.png,"to caress every inch with his mouth as well , to"
k07-059a-05.png,creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
k07-059a-06.png,himself in a rapture of kisses in places he 'd
k07-059a-07.png,"dreamed of , where life began to ooze and quickened"
k07-059a-08.png,his heart beat to a thunder .
k07-063a-00.png,"He looked at her . Head thrown back in a pool of hair ,"
k07-063a-01.png,her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her
k07-063a-02.png,heart in the full throat . Her mouth did things he
k07-063a-03.png,thought no human being could stand without
k07-063a-04.png,"dying , but he went on living in an ocean of"
k07-063a-05.png,"voluptuousness , that swelled and ebbed over him ,"
k07-063a-06.png,"under him , in him and through him ..."
k07-067a-00.png,He was having a ball ! He twiddled the TV set with
k07-067a-01.png,shaking hands . She sat calmly on the bed smoking
k07-067a-02.png,a cigarette . His face was white with two red
k07-067a-03.png,blotches . Hers was flushed and lovely . O.K. teacher !
k07-067a-04.png,Was that any better ? You know it was ! You don't
k07-067a-05.png,"need teaching , only a little coaxing ."
k07-077-00.png,He sat down and ran his finger down along her
k07-077-01.png,spine . Do you love me now ? Like yesterday ! I 'm
k07-077-02.png,extremely fond of you . The fact that you 're beginning
k07-077-03.png,to satisfy my physical wants does not change that .
k07-077-04.png,Before long you 'll give me the satisfaction that 'll set
k07-077-05.png,"me rocking on my feet , but I 'll still be only fond of"
k07-077-06.png,you . But you wouldn't marry me ?
k07-085-00.png,No . I 'm not your type . I 'd make you miserable . I
k07-085-01.png,mean that . I 'd very probably be unfaithful and
k07-085-02.png,"that 'd kill you . Then I 'd be unfaithful too , to teach"
k07-085-03.png,you a lesson . It wouldn't work . You 'd do it to
k07-085-04.png,spite me . I would never do it for that reason .
k07-085-05.png,To me it 'd be immaterial whether you 'd retaliate
k07-085-06.png,or not . You 'd go crazy if that situation arose .
k07-122-00.png,To observe the colour rise in her cheek
k07-122-01.png,"and hear her breath come faster , to see"
k07-122-02.png,the slight beads of sweat come out on
k07-122-03.png,her glistening skin and see her move
k07-122-04.png,with uncontrolled rhythm . To have her twist
k07-122-05.png,in an attempt to receive a caress he was
k07-122-06.png,"purposely withholding , to hear her deep-throated"
k07-122-07.png,moan of full satisfaction and feel her
k07-122-08.png,"shivering , clawing surrender ."
k07-125-00.png,"Not so dusty , she might say afterwards , drawing at"
k07-125-01.png,a cigarette . It 's a wow ! he said . She kissed
k07-125-02.png,him motherly : You just wait till you teach the
k07-125-03.png,girl you really love . He didn't protest any more
k07-125-04.png,to say he loved her because he knew it to
k07-125-05.png,be untrue . Instead he said : Will that be
k07-125-06.png,better ? She nodded :
k07-134-00.png,It 's man's nature to teach and to teach those
k07-134-01.png,we love is double pleasure . And she
k07-134-02.png,might add : And don't forget to leave the
k07-134-03.png,lights on . You lose half the fun when you
k07-134-04.png,fumble in the dark . She had many direct
k07-134-05.png,comments like that . Once she quietly
k07-134-06.png,pushed him back when he kissed her too
k07-134-07.png,fully and too soon :
k07-141-00.png,"Oi , not yet , you oaf . What do you think my"
k07-141-01.png,mouth is ? A billposter's bucket to be
k07-141-02.png,plunged in at random ? He 'd learned to
k07-141-03.png,laugh when something went wrong or the
k07-141-04.png,"situation became ludicrous , as when they"
k07-141-05.png,were both caught in the raw when he 'd
k07-141-06.png,forgotten to lock his door and Derek
k07-141-07.png,had walked in unexpectedly .
k07-146-00.png,They 'd just had time to nip into the
k07-146-01.png,bathroom and stood there shivering for
k07-146-02.png,fifteen minutes while their guest was
k07-146-03.png,smoking a cigarette waiting for him .
k07-146-04.png,At last Derek got tired and left .
k07-146-05.png,"Just in time , erupted Charlie . If he 'd"
k07-146-06.png,stayed any longer I 'd jolly well
k07-146-07.png,have asked him to join us . I 'm so
k07-146-08.png,darned cold I could do with two men .
k07-152-00.png,"You perverted sex-maniac , you wouldn't"
k07-152-01.png,dare . Show me what you can do and
k07-152-02.png,I 'll tell you if you need help .
k07-152-03.png,Once he came back to the subject
k07-152-04.png,of her marriage and asked her why
k07-152-05.png,she was going to marry her sculptor .
k07-152-06.png,"Because I love him , of course ."
k07-152-07.png,What do you think ?
k07-158-00.png,"But he 's a lot older , isn't he ?"
k07-158-01.png,I suppose so . What attracts you ?
k07-158-02.png,It can't be physical ? Of course
k07-158-03.png,not ! I love him for what he is
k07-158-04.png,- he 's so great I 'm a bit scared
k07-158-05.png,of him - a woman must be a bit
k07-158-06.png,scared to be really in love .
k07-158-07.png,That 's why you could never
k07-158-08.png,love me ?
k07-166-00.png,"Correct , ducky ! You just wait till"
k07-166-01.png,you meet the girl who thinks you 're a
k07-166-02.png,god . It 'll make you feel like one !
k07-166-03.png,You think that sculptor 's a god ?
k07-166-04.png,"Perhaps , in a way . All I know is"
k07-166-05.png,that I need him . He kissed the
k07-166-06.png,heart beat in her throat . But how
k07-166-07.png,about the physical side ? You 're
k07-166-08.png,quite an erotic little beast ; can
k07-166-09.png,he satisfy that ?

k07-176-11.png,he used to spend with her .
k07-185-00.png,He often used to try to imagine
k07-185-01.png,her reactions if he had once treated
k07-185-02.png,"her as he did Charlie , but his"
k07-185-03.png,imagination failed . The efficient
k07-185-04.png,little Mary would probably have
k07-185-05.png,called it a shocking waste of time
k07-185-06.png,and told him to get down to

k07-185-10.png,him a membership ticket for a
k07-185-11.png,small club for artists only .
l01-000-00.png,He did well . He got in touch with
l01-000-01.png,the woman Pete was passing off as his
l01-000-02.png,mother . Starmouth managed to
l01-000-03.png,win her confidence . It seems that
l01-000-04.png,"she was an honest enough woman ,"
l01-000-05.png,only her mind wasn't as clear as
l01-000-06.png,it could have been . She showed
l01-000-07.png,him photographs . He found out
l01-000-08.png,that the name of her house - Grand
l01-000-09.png,Greve - was taken from a bay
l01-000-10.png,in one of the Channel Islands .
l01-007-00.png,"One of the small ones . Sark , that 's it . The Caxtons"
l01-007-01.png,used to have their holidays there . Starmouth went
l01-007-02.png,there . He dug out some people who remembered
l01-007-03.png,the family . In the end he pieced it all together .
l01-007-04.png,The Caxtons had two boys - Michael and Derek .
l01-007-05.png,Pete first met them at school .
l01-016-00.png,"It was a good school I sent him to , one of the best ."
l01-016-01.png,He was a boarder . He could always turn on the
l01-016-02.png,charm when it suited him . The whole family
l01-016-03.png,came to like him . The real Michael - he was the
l01-016-04.png,same age as my son - died of pleurisy when he
l01-016-05.png,was eighteen . Soon after that Pete staged his
l01-016-06.png,drowning .
l01-023-00.png,He was always a smooth liar . He invented some
l01-023-01.png,plausible story or other and threw himself on
l01-023-02.png,the Caxtons' generosity . They accepted him as a
l01-023-03.png,kind of substitute for the boy they had lost .
l01-023-04.png,Outside the family he began to pass himself
l01-023-05.png,off as Michael Caxton . The father was well-off
l01-023-06.png,and easy-going . He was easy meat for Pete .
l01-030-00.png,He sponged off him until he died
l01-030-01.png,just after the war . Then Pete had to
l01-030-02.png,look around for some other
l01-030-03.png,"security . He found it - Dackson's Wharf ,"
l01-030-04.png,and Dackson's daughter . Mrs. Caxton's
l01-030-05.png,"other boy , Derek , had been killed in the war ."
l01-030-06.png,After her husband died her brain began
l01-030-07.png,to fade . At times she thought Pete was
l01-030-08.png,really her own son .
l01-050-00.png,My chance had come at last . I had to
l01-050-01.png,take it . I was going to smash him as
l01-050-02.png,he had twice tried to smash me . ( His
l01-050-03.png,"eyes , wild and frightened , were fixed on"
l01-050-04.png,Tong . Tong guessed that they did not

l01-050-06.png,once and report exactly what he had
l01-050-07.png,seen to Dackson and his daughter .
l01-050-08.png,He did as he was told .

l01-065-04.png,precise minute of Dackson's visit
l01-065-05.png,"the previous Wednesday , and ended"
l01-065-06.png,by admitting that he was in fact

l04-082-04.png,cold . His eye automatically glanced towards the
l04-082-05.png,panel which concealed the hiding-place of his
l04-082-06.png,secret treasure . For an instant he stood
l04-082-07.png,"transfixed to the floor , his eyes unwavering"
l04-082-08.png,as they riveted themselves on the wall .
l04-087-00.png,Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided ?
l04-087-01.png,Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
l04-087-02.png,panel and pulled it out . The black tin box was exactly
l04-087-03.png,as he had left it . With heavily beating heart he reached
l04-087-04.png,out and lifted the lid . Everything was intact and he
l04-087-05.png,gasped with relief .
l04-093-00.png,He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
l04-093-01.png,"to count them . Of course , he remembered being in a great hurry to get"
l04-093-02.png,that fifty pounds for Kitty ! Obviously he had been careless in
l04-093-03.png,"replacing the panel , but the possibility of anyone having"
l04-093-04.png,discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock .
l04-093-05.png,"As he replaced the bundles of notes , he withdrew the tin"
l04-093-06.png,box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
l04-093-07.png,cupboard .
l04-098-00.png,It would be safer under lock and key
l04-098-01.png,for the time being than behind a piece
l04-098-02.png,of panelling which did not fit very sec-
l04-098-03.png,urely . Tomorrow he would buy a
l04-098-04.png,heavy padlock for the box and search
l04-098-05.png,"for a new hiding-place . He lay in bed ,"
l04-098-06.png,"cold and uneasy , unable to account"
l04-098-07.png,for an instinctive sense of danger .
l04-102-00.png,When he closed his eyes it was
l04-102-01.png,"Henry Mansell's face he saw , hovering"
l04-102-02.png,above his head like a hideous caricature . The
l04-102-03.png,"parrot nose and straight line of the mouth ,"
l04-102-04.png,the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip
l04-102-05.png,him right down to his abjectly quaking
l04-102-06.png,bones . The mouldering horror that had
l04-102-07.png,once been Henry Mansell taunted him
l04-102-08.png,now in the silent darkness .
l04-106-00.png,In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at
l04-106-01.png,Hawkeshurst that Friday night Hugh Mansell and Roddy
l04-106-02.png,Dowell drank their beer and waited . ' It 's too damn busy
l04-106-03.png,"in here . We can't expect him to leave his customers ' ,"
l04-106-04.png,"Hugh said morosely . ' Give him a chance , old chap ."
l04-106-05.png,He 'll be over . Jim 's a most reliable chap when
l04-106-06.png,it comes to picking up a small tip . '
l04-113-00.png,"' O.K. , Roddy , whatever you say . ' Hugh drained his glass and"
l04-113-01.png,ordered two more beers . ' I 'm really beginning to feel it 's
l04-113-02.png,"all a bit of a waste of time , anyway . I 've been collecting"
l04-113-03.png,scraps of evidence and piecing them together for four
l04-113-04.png,"months now , and the whole lot still doesn't amount to"
l04-113-05.png,anything one could call concrete . '
l04-118-00.png,"Roddy puffed at his pipe , his eyes fixed on the white-coated"
l04-118-01.png,"barman . ' Oh , I think it does , Hugh . That 's"
l04-118-02.png,why I want you to meet this bird . I think
l04-118-03.png,he fills in an important part of the
l04-118-04.png,"background . Furthermore , dear boy , it confirms"
l04-118-05.png,what we already know of your father's
l04-118-06.png,intention to leave the country on the night
l04-118-07.png,of October 14th . '
l04-124-00.png,Hugh nodded . His face wore the melancholy expression
l04-124-01.png,that was habitual to him but his eyes showed
l04-124-02.png,"his inner excitement . ' I know , but from the"
l04-124-03.png,moment he walked out of here we haven't a
l04-124-04.png,shred of evidence to prove what happened .
l04-124-05.png,"Obviously he met someone , either by chance or"
l04-124-06.png,"by arrangement . Whichever way it was , that"
l04-124-07.png,person had a gun and he managed to persuade
l04-124-08.png,Father to drive along that quiet stretch of
l04-124-09.png,road ... . '
l04-130-00.png,' Miles off his proper route to Dover or the airport at
l04-130-01.png,"Lydd ' , Roddy interposed quickly . ' And once there he was"
l04-130-02.png,shot at close range and his money smartly filched .
l04-130-03.png,"You know , whoever it was might have known of the"
l04-130-04.png,existence of the suicide letter ... providing him with
l04-130-05.png,an almost unshakable alibi . ' Hugh was thinking of
l04-130-06.png,"his uncle , but said nothing . After all , Julian had"
l04-130-07.png,"acted very strangely since the tragedy , always"
l04-130-08.png,"secretive , always reluctant to discuss his brother's"
l04-130-09.png,death .
l04-136-00.png,It was impossible to associate him in one's mind with a
l04-136-01.png,"cold-blooded murder but , in fact , Henry Mansell's"
l04-136-02.png,death had saved the firm and Julian's future .
l04-136-03.png,Moreover he might well have been aware of his
l04-136-04.png,brother's intention to skip out of the country and
l04-136-05.png,"passed on the information . ' I 'm sure you 're right ' ,"
l04-136-06.png,Hugh said thoughtfully . ' But whoever did it got
l04-136-07.png,clean away without being spotted . '
l04-141-00.png,"' Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter ,"
l04-141-01.png,"believe me ' , Roddy affirmed solemnly . ' He probably caught"
l04-141-02.png,the next boat across the channel and has been lying low
l04-141-03.png,with the money somewhere . ' Hugh nodded . ' I realized that
l04-141-04.png,after my talk with Mrs. Lawford . There are a dozen countries
l04-141-05.png,where a man could easily hide up and change the money
l04-141-06.png,without danger .
l04-147-00.png,Unless we can get a definite line on him it 's
l04-147-01.png,"hopeless ... . ' ' Something will turn up one day , you 'll see ' ,"
l04-147-02.png,Roddy said confidently . ' If we plug away at the leads
l04-147-03.png,we have ... . ' ' If only the police would do something ... ' Hugh
l04-147-04.png,cried out in exasperation . ' I 've put everything I know
l04-147-05.png,before them ... . '
l04-153-00.png,"' No dice , Hugh . ' Roddy shook his sandy head ."
l04-153-01.png,' They 're bound to want pretty solid new evidence
l04-153-02.png,before they 'll agree to reopen the case . From
l04-153-03.png,their point of view the evidence for suicide is
l04-153-04.png,overwhelming . I spoke to a chap from the office of
l04-153-05.png,the Director of Public Prosecutions I know pretty
l04-153-06.png,"well , and he agreed that the missing cash is"
l04-153-07.png,a hell of a mystery .
l04-159-00.png,But as he quite reasonably pointed out the
l04-159-01.png,money could have been disposed of in London
l04-159-02.png,before your father left that evening . It wouldn't be
l04-159-03.png,unnatural for a man in his position to make provision
l04-159-04.png,for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded
l04-159-05.png,as particular debts of honour before taking his own
l04-159-06.png,"life . Also , logically , there 's nothing to show the"
l04-159-07.png,money couldn't have been pinched by someone
l04-159-08.png,passing the car after your father was dead .
l04-163-00.png,Stealing from cars is about the commonest
l04-163-01.png,kind of crime in the book . There 's nothing
l04-163-02.png,that absolutely ties the missing money to the
l04-163-03.png,"circumstances of your father 's death , that 's"
l04-163-04.png,the point . Same with the passport . It 's gone
l04-163-05.png,and that 's that . It may turn up in a dustbin
l04-163-06.png,somewhere or at the back of a drawer . As
l04-163-07.png,far as the police are concerned there 's nothing
l04-163-08.png,to go on .
l04-170-00.png,In our own minds we may be pretty sure what
l04-170-01.png,"happened , but that 's not good enough for them ."
l04-170-02.png,That suicide letter did the trick - definite proof
l04-170-03.png,"that your father took his life , backed by"
l04-170-04.png,medical evidence and the fingerprint chaps . '
l04-170-05.png,A little man with thin brown hair and a
l04-170-06.png,ruddy complexion came over and greeted
l04-170-07.png,them .
l04-174-00.png,He wore a short white coat . Hugh ordered drinks .
l04-174-01.png,' I was sorry to read about your dad in the
l04-174-02.png,"paper ' , the man said to Hugh in a thick"
l04-174-03.png,voice which bore traces of a cockney accent .
l04-174-04.png,' I was telling your friend how he come
l04-174-05.png,in here the very night he passed away . '
l04-179-00.png,Hugh wasn't impressed with this ingratiating bar-
l04-179-01.png,man whom Roddy had raked up . He was seedy and
l04-179-02.png,middle-aged with small black eyes set close to-
l04-179-03.png,"gether beneath heavily marked brows and a sly ,"
l04-179-04.png,crafty expression that failed to inspire confidence .
l04-179-05.png,"' He was hitting the bottle pretty hard , sir ... ' the"
l04-179-06.png,man said in a loud whisper . ' Meaning no offe-
l04-179-07.png,"nce ' , he added , looking at Hugh ."
l07-052-00.png,""" Why ? "" he asked again . "" I can tell by your voice that it means"
l07-052-01.png,"a lot to you , but I 'm damned if I can see the reason . It 's not as"
l07-052-02.png,"if you were all that fond of Alice . "" He was interrupted by the"
l07-052-03.png,arrival of the food and wine . When the pouring ritual was over he
l07-052-04.png,went on :

l07-065-04.png,"to myself , in moments of optimism , that it was not true ."
l07-074-00.png,"If you 're right , you may be in serious danger from Hardy ."
l07-074-01.png,Even if you 're wrong you 'll most certainly be in danger when
l07-074-02.png,"you start handling a boat . "" He picked up his glass and"
l07-074-03.png,"held it in both hands , looking at me thoughtfully over the"
l07-074-04.png,"top of it . "" No , "" he said at last . "" I can't allow # #"

l07-080-00.png,""" You can't very well stop me . "" "" I can"
l07-080-01.png,do better than that . If we were to

l07-080-04.png,"plate , not daring to let him see"
l07-080-05.png,how much the idea appealed to
l07-080-06.png,"me , reminding myself that he could"
l07-080-07.png,only have said such a thing

l07-080-09.png,whole truth .

l07-085-01.png,""" Deadlock , "" said Max . "" No , it isn't ."

l07-103-00.png,""" You can see it any time you like , """
l07-103-01.png,"he told me . "" The sooner the better ."
l07-103-02.png,If you can get to Bletcham this
l07-103-03.png,evening I 'll run you up there
l07-103-04.png,"in the car . "" "" That 's very nice of"
l07-103-05.png,"you . "" "" Nice , nothing . I told you ,"
l07-103-06.png,I 'm mad about boats . Seven

l07-111-01.png,""" No , "" I said , "" outside your office . """
l07-111-02.png,I could not endure the thought
l07-111-03.png,of another wait at the bus station .
l07-111-04.png,He was there punctually . Dressed
l07-111-05.png,in a loud tartan shirt and abbreviated
l07-111-06.png,shorts he looked hardly more than
l07-111-07.png,"a boy , a cheerful , good-natured"
l07-111-08.png,boy . He settled me into the car
l07-111-09.png,with touching care and then
l07-111-10.png,drove like a fiend along
l07-111-11.png,the river road .
l07-118-00.png,Ten minutes later he stopped in a lane
l07-118-01.png,and helped me out with the same
l07-118-02.png,"careful courtesy . "" What sort of boat is it ? """
l07-118-03.png,"I asked . "" She , "" he corrected . "" She 's a"
l07-118-04.png,"converted life-boat . Not a very good one ,"
l07-118-05.png,but she 's sound enough and the
l07-118-06.png,"engine 's fine . """
l07-131-00.png,"Inside , she was untidy and grubby but"
l07-131-01.png,roomy enough and well lit by two rows of
l07-131-02.png,good-sized windows . It was a long time
l07-131-03.png,before I got used to calling them
l07-131-04.png,portholes . The owner was a middle-aged
l07-131-05.png,man whose family had tired of the
l07-131-06.png,limited excitement of the river and now
l07-131-07.png,had their eyes on a seagoing boat .
l07-135-00.png,Clive - he insisted on being called Clive -
l07-135-01.png,haggled with him and within half an hour
l07-135-02.png,Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
l07-135-03.png,fifty pounds . When all the business details
l07-135-04.png,had been settled and the owner had
l07-135-05.png,"departed with my cheque in his pocket ,"
l07-135-06.png,Clive started the engine and gave me my
l07-135-07.png,first lesson in manoeuvring up and down
l07-135-08.png,the river and in and out of the other boats .
l07-138-00.png,"It was a warm , still evening ; the plop of"
l07-138-01.png,fish and the gentle putter of the engine
l07-138-02.png,"were infinitely soothing after city noises ,"
l07-138-03.png,and I began to look forward to my life
l07-138-04.png,on the water . At last he pronounced
l07-138-05.png,me riverworthy and wanted to know when
l07-138-06.png,I would be moving in .
l07-172-00.png,"Like Clive , he was enthusiastic about the"
l07-172-01.png,"engine and decided , apparently on the strength"
l07-172-02.png,"of its efficiency , that Sandpiper was fit to"
l07-172-03.png,live in . I was more than thankful for his help
l07-172-04.png,when we had installed my things and the
l07-172-05.png,boat began to move . The river was crowded
l07-172-06.png,with flocks of sailing boats which
l07-172-07.png,swirled round us like gulls and there
l07-172-08.png,"were two locks to negotiate , but Max"
l07-172-09.png,seemed to know exactly what to do
l07-172-10.png,and at the same time kept me supplied
l07-176-00.png,""" How on earth do you know all this ? "" I asked"
l07-176-01.png,"him . "" I used to play about in these things"
l07-176-02.png,when I was a kid . And then I acted as guide
l07-176-03.png,"on a river boat one summer , to keep myself"
l07-176-04.png,"going between terms at college . "" It was"
l07-176-05.png,"the first I had heard of it , but that 's"
l07-176-06.png,one of the things I like about Max .
l07-181-00.png,He has done so many things that there
l07-181-01.png,is always something new and exciting to
l07-181-02.png,"discover about him . "" You 're wonderful , "" I"
l07-181-03.png,"said , meaning it . He pressed the tip of my"
l07-181-04.png,"nose with one finger . "" That makes two of us . """
l07-181-05.png,It was about eight o'clock in the evening
l07-181-06.png,when we tied up almost exactly opposite
l07-181-07.png,Hardy's garden and went up on to the
l07-181-08.png,roof of the cabin to see what we could see .
l07-187-00.png,"From this side , Rivermead was less forbidding ;"
l07-187-01.png,it stood a long way back from the water
l07-187-02.png,at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
l07-187-03.png,flowering trees and shrubs . To the right of
l07-187-04.png,"the lawn , close to the water's edge , stood an"
l07-187-05.png,ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria ; it
l07-187-06.png,was built across a narrow backwater
l07-187-07.png,and there was a delicate iron staircase
l07-187-08.png,climbing the outer wall to a room above .
l07-190-00.png,""" You won't see anyone tonight , it 's too late , "" Max"
l07-190-01.png,"said and turned to go . "" No - wait , "" I put out a"
l07-190-02.png,hand to stop him . The sun was no longer shining
l07-190-03.png,"and it was dark across there by the trees ,"
l07-190-04.png,but I thought I had seen something move .
m01-000-00.png,"A shudder , more mental than physical , ran"
m01-000-01.png,"through him , and his mind seemed to"
m01-000-02.png,melt away into emptiness . His bulging
m01-000-03.png,"eyes caught the reclining form of Heather ,"
m01-000-04.png,who was still repeating in sing-song :
m01-000-05.png,""" ... I will not give in ... "" He stared at her"
m01-000-06.png,"blankly , mouthing an incoherent gabble"
m01-000-07.png,of half words .
m01-012-00.png,He slapped himself in the face and
m01-012-01.png,cuffed the sides of his head . Then
m01-012-02.png,by degrees the rotating objects
m01-012-03.png,"slowed , and coming into focus took"
m01-012-04.png,the form of the furnishings in Dan
m01-012-05.png,Brown's living room . He stood up un-
m01-012-06.png,"steadily and looked about the room ,"
m01-012-07.png,trying to gather his wits . Outside the
m01-012-08.png,dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and
m01-012-09.png,the heights beyond were in
m01-012-10.png,"silhouette , already a solid black ."
m01-017-00.png,He bumped into a floor lamp and
m01-017-01.png,switched it on . Heather McNabb still lay
m01-017-02.png,"on the couch , her body uncomfortably twisted"
m01-017-03.png,and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks .
m01-017-04.png,He went to the kitchen for water and found
m01-017-05.png,Dan . Dan was lying on a long bench in the
m01-017-06.png,"breakfast nook , his head bent upright"
m01-017-07.png,against the wall .
m01-022-00.png,"His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat ,"
m01-022-01.png,as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks
m01-022-02.png,"brought forward . He mouthed a low mutter , punctuated at intervals"
m01-022-03.png,with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon . As
m01-022-04.png,"Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut ,"
m01-022-05.png,with jaws askew .
m01-026-00.png,There was utter imbecility in his blank face . Presently the
m01-026-01.png,"muttering started again , and went on and on . Stunned and"
m01-026-02.png,"shaken , Steve drew a glass of water and went back to"
m01-026-03.png,Heather . Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still
m01-026-04.png,trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects .
m01-026-05.png,For several minutes they had been facing each other across
m01-026-06.png,"a low table , like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with"
m01-026-07.png,each other through forced association .
m01-032-00.png,Then something like a zest for living began to come back
m01-032-01.png,to Steve and he squeezed her hand . Her face took on
m01-032-02.png,enough animation to produce a wan smile . Dan's low mut-
m01-032-03.png,tering was just audible from the kitchen . And Steve
m01-032-04.png,could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions
m01-032-05.png,she was growing cold and numb with shock . She had seen
m01-032-06.png,"Dan , or rather the physical relic of him - the empty"

m01-032-08.png,personality .
m01-038-00.png,"And these had been his great qualities ,"
m01-038-01.png,so attractive to her . The Base Station had
m01-038-02.png,"gone before , discharging its narrow plane of"
m01-038-03.png,4ementalating energy along the length of
m01-038-04.png,"the Earth's imaginary longitudes , moving"
m01-038-05.png,eastward like a knife-edged twilight in
m01-038-06.png,reversed progression . It had brought the
m01-038-07.png,"First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest ,"
m01-038-08.png,the empty-minded receptiveness that
m01-038-09.png,prepared the way for the Second Stage .
m01-049-00.png,He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
m01-049-01.png,"and came into the livingroom , where"
m01-049-02.png,Heather and Steve stood aghast at
m01-049-03.png,"his entrance . He came , almost falling"
m01-049-04.png,"forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck"
m01-049-05.png,"thrust out , arms dangling loosely ."
m01-049-06.png,"Then , abruptly , he drew himself up"
m01-049-07.png,and walked on the very tips of
m01-049-08.png,his toes . He stretched his arms
m01-049-09.png,"over his head and yawned agape ,"
m01-049-10.png,drawing-in great breaths that
m01-049-11.png,became great sighs of ecstacy .
m01-060-00.png,""" They have come ! "" he said reverently , gripping his"
m01-060-01.png,hands together between his knees and leaning
m01-060-02.png,"forward . "" Isn't it a glorious thing ! Long awaited"
m01-060-03.png,"transcendent event , the exalted desire of all"
m01-060-04.png,mankind through all ages ! The Kingdom of the
m01-060-05.png,"Mind is at hand ! "" He turned beaming eyes"
m01-060-06.png,upward and shook his head slowly from
m01-060-07.png,side to side .
m01-079-00.png,A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
m01-079-01.png,abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
m01-079-02.png,at an intersection for the light to change . At his
m01-079-03.png,apartment he garaged his car and then stood
m01-079-04.png,listening in the night . Listening in vain . For the
m01-079-05.png,"earth had lost its life-tempo , as the heart"
m01-079-06.png,loses its beat in death .
m01-084-00.png,"Deadly stillness , deadly portent !"
m01-084-01.png,Steve awakened early and switched on
m01-084-02.png,"the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO."
m01-084-03.png,The set lighted-up but gave only a low
m01-084-04.png,buzzing sound . He had just finished
m01-084-05.png,"shaving when it came on , with a flat"
m01-084-06.png,"voice repeating : "" This is BBC calling"
m01-084-07.png,"... this is BBC calling ... """
m01-090-00.png,"After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice"
m01-090-01.png,went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
m01-090-02.png,"in Sussex , in all its obscene details . Then the radio"
m01-090-03.png,"went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for"
m01-090-04.png,"breakfast . It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June"
m01-090-05.png,should be . Steve got out the car and traversed the
m01-090-06.png,"same empty streets as he had the night before ,"
m01-090-07.png,to keep an appointment with Heather .
m01-095-00.png,Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
m01-095-01.png,"Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A"
m01-095-02.png,flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
m01-095-03.png,the War Memorial . There was a deep
m01-095-04.png,"whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing"
m01-095-05.png,overtone that sang in his ears with an
m01-095-06.png,almost painful sharpness . He reversed and
m01-095-07.png,turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
m01-100-00.png,The Thetans must not see him ! He took another route
m01-100-01.png,to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on
m01-100-02.png,the way . Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at
m01-100-03.png,once ; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss
m01-100-04.png,"their situation , as far as it could be assessed ,"
m01-100-05.png,and to decide on what seemed to be the best
m01-100-06.png,way of meeting it .
m01-104-00.png,""" The Thetans , "" he said , "" are presumably here to"
m01-104-01.png,"take charge , as it were , of the minds of the"
m01-104-02.png,people - who are probably falling all over them-
m01-104-03.png,selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
m01-104-04.png,"them out . Just what these orders will be , we don't"
m01-104-05.png,"know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es-"
m01-104-06.png,caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no
m01-104-07.png,longer have any immunity .
m01-110-00.png,There can be little doubt that if the
m01-110-01.png,Thetans discover our mental independence
m01-110-02.png,they will promptly give us their hypnotic
m01-110-03.png,treatment . If we can avoid undue
m01-110-04.png,"prominence , it may be that we can"
m01-110-05.png,move about pretty freely without
m01-110-06.png,"detection . If we can - well , then we"
m01-110-07.png,may be able to promote our own
m01-110-08.png,interests . What those interests
m01-110-09.png,"are , beyond personal security ,"
m01-110-10.png,"I haven't a clue ; but , who knows ,"
m01-110-11.png,we may form the nucleus around ...
m01-115-00.png,""" Now , to summarize what I think our"
m01-115-01.png,"course of action should be . First , to avoid the"
m01-115-02.png,"Thetans like the plague , for they must not"
m01-115-03.png,"find us out ! Second , to tread pretty warily"
m01-115-04.png,"among our own people , finding out just how"
m01-115-05.png,much freedom we can take with safety .
m01-115-06.png,"And third , to study these damned Thetans ."
m01-115-07.png,We must learn all we can about
m01-115-08.png,them .
m01-121-00.png,There is just a hope that we may uncover
m01-121-01.png,"some weakness , and find a way of fighting"
m01-121-02.png,"back at them . "" Heather agreed , and suggested"
m01-121-03.png,that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
m01-121-04.png,ting how the Thetan machinations had been
m01-121-05.png,working out . It occurred to Steve that this may
m01-121-06.png,not have been entirely an objective suggestion
m01-121-07.png,on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
m01-121-08.png,nevertheless .
m01-125-00.png,So they proceeded to see if the coast
m01-125-01.png,was clear . The street was quiet and
m01-125-02.png,"deserted , and there were neither sight"
m01-125-03.png,nor sound of flying saucers . So they
m01-125-04.png,ventured forth and made their way on
m01-125-05.png,foot to Dan's house . Dan came
m01-125-06.png,to the door at their ring but neglected
m01-125-07.png,to offer any greeting . He was deeply
m01-125-08.png,"preoccupied , and it seemed that the"
m01-125-09.png,ringing of a doorbell was to him
m01-125-10.png,a new and strange phenomenon .
m01-131-00.png,"When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action"
m01-131-01.png,gave the impression of having been thought out and
m01-131-02.png,"decided upon . Inside they sat down unbidden , while"
m01-131-03.png,Dan paced the floor . He seemed completely unaware
m01-131-04.png,"of their presence . They just stared at him , turning"
m01-131-05.png,their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
m01-131-06.png,"down , up and down ."
m01-136-00.png,His whole attitude was a mixture of
m01-136-01.png,impatience pending an awaited
m01-136-02.png,communication and of a vague
m01-136-03.png,perplexity respecting his surroundings
m01-136-04.png,and the purpose he was to serve .
m01-136-05.png,"Finally , being so obviously on their own ,"
m01-136-06.png,Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
m01-136-07.png,at home . Steve switched on Dan's
m01-136-08.png,"powerful , world-wide radio and systematically"
m01-136-09.png,turned the tuning knob through all the
m01-136-10.png,tuning points of the world's great radio
m01-149-00.png,"They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where"
m01-149-01.png,he waited . The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street .
m01-149-02.png,"But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon"
m01-149-03.png,the Avenue from its many tributary streets . It might have
m01-149-04.png,"been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies ."
m01-149-05.png,"First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone"
m01-149-06.png,"walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of"
m01-149-07.png,a single all-exclusive purpose .
m01-160-00.png,After a long wait a bus appeared and they
m01-160-01.png,"followed the beaming Dan aboard , taking"
m01-160-02.png,seats some rows behind him . Steve was
m01-160-03.png,"beginning to find the stereotyped , flattish , happy"
m01-160-04.png,faces very disconcerting ; and looking at
m01-160-05.png,Heather he found a welcome relief in her
m01-160-06.png,relatively long doleful one
m02-048-00.png,Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
m02-048-01.png,real days and would return to New York in late
m02-048-02.png,January or early February . Angelina might be a
m02-048-03.png,little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
m02-048-04.png,"as arranged , but he consoled himself by"
m02-048-05.png,thinking that he and Angelina would have
m02-048-06.png,plenty of time together in the future . And
m02-048-07.png,"Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be"
m02-048-08.png,"back on Moon again , and able to do"
m02-048-09.png,research at first hand into matters on which
m02-048-10.png,"the future of everyone , including Angelina , depended ..."
m02-052-00.png,The recovery of his balance was due to the
m02-052-01.png,"fact that he was living , virtually without"
m02-052-02.png,"expenses , with the people to whom Moke had"
m02-052-03.png,sent him : little people who regarded him as
m02-052-04.png,lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes .

m02-102-00.png,At the centre of each circle stood personnel

m03-062-02.png,resemblance to the shrunk heads we had
m03-062-03.png,gazed at recently ; and I have no
m03-062-04.png,hesitation in saying that they would have
m03-062-05.png,made an end of us but for an intervention
m03-062-06.png,"so unexpected , so unusual , that only the"
m03-062-07.png,necessity of rounding my narrative
m03-062-08.png,compels me to mention it .
m03-095-00.png,I had a distinct impression that the
m03-095-01.png,hut had recently been cleaned and
m03-095-02.png,prepared for visitors . Mrs Caine said
m03-095-03.png,we were to go no further unless and
m03-095-04.png,"until we were sent for , confirming"
m03-095-05.png,another impression that became more
m03-095-06.png,"and more definite , namely , that"
m03-095-07.png,she was in touch with an invi-
m03-095-08.png,sible source of authority .
m03-110-00.png,"Sally and of course Mrs Septimus , for surely"
m03-110-01.png,Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
m03-110-02.png,myself ? But was it so ? I allowed myself
m03-110-03.png,"to entertain for an instant the idea , the"
m03-110-04.png,"strange , the unwelcome , the almost"
m03-110-05.png,"inconceivable idea , that Ariadne's arrival"
m03-110-06.png,would be inopportune ; and with the idea came
m03-110-07.png,"a somewhat vulgar impulse , which I refused ,"
m03-110-08.png,"to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs"
m03-110-09.png,Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
m03-114-00.png,But all three were to the casual
m03-114-01.png,observation I permitted myself unruffled ;
m03-114-02.png,Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
m03-114-03.png,"thoughtful , but that was his habit . Indeed"
m03-114-04.png,we were all invaded by a most tranquil
m03-114-05.png,"mood . Even the Indian servants relaxed , knowing ,"
m03-114-06.png,"so Mr Gilberto told us , that the wild and"
m03-114-07.png,savage tribes never approached this region : at
m03-114-08.png,"any rate they remained with us , perhaps"
m03-114-09.png,"for such protection as our presence , or Mrs"
m03-118-00.png,But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
m03-118-01.png,far from our minds that at any moment we were
m03-118-02.png,to receive a summons . I could see that Mr Septimus
m03-118-03.png,"was impatient for it . This afternoon , then , we climbed"
m03-118-04.png,"a promontory , a mass of clean rock crowned with"
m03-118-05.png,"trees and bushes , that stood well out over the lake ."
m04-000-00.png,NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a
m04-000-01.png,single-decker Welsh bus could have got
m04-000-02.png,itself into orbit . Shooting up over the pass a bit
m04-000-03.png,"too carefree , and becoming airborne ?"
m04-000-04.png,Caught by a sudden gust of wind ? A
m04-000-05.png,combination of the two ? No one seems
m04-000-06.png,to know . But the fact remains that get
m04-000-07.png,itself into orbit it did .

m04-038-01.png,"on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly"
m04-038-02.png,scene . The first intimation that all was not well came when a

m04-038-04.png,Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their

m06-019-05.png,talk from you of the Heavy World ! You have
m06-019-06.png,"joined us . You are flymen , we are human . You"

m06-031-00.png,"' But we - ' ' Stop your stupid talk , woman ! ' ' We are - '"
m06-031-01.png,"' Be silent , woman , and listen , ' Band Appa Bondi said ."
m06-031-02.png,"' We know much , ' repeated the Chief Captive . ' Some"
m06-031-03.png,things we will tell you . All who make the journey from
m06-031-04.png,the Heavy World become changed . Some die . Most live
m06-031-05.png,and grow wings . Between the worlds are many strong
m06-031-06.png,"rays , not seen or felt , which change our bodies ."
m06-042-00.png,"When you come here , when you come to the True"
m06-042-01.png,"World , you become a true human . The grub of the"
m06-042-02.png,tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes . So humans
m06-042-03.png,"change . ' ' I cannot know what he says , ' Haris said"
m06-042-04.png,"stubbornly , throwing himself down . But Lily-yo and"
m06-042-05.png,Flor were listening .
m06-048-00.png,"' To this True World , as you call it , we come to die , '"
m06-048-01.png,"Lily-yo said , doubtingly . The Captive with the"
m06-048-02.png,"fleshless jaw said , ' The grub of the tigerfly thinks"
m06-048-03.png,it dies when it changes into a tigerfly . ' ' You are still
m06-048-04.png,"young , ' said the Chief Captive . ' You begin newly here ."
m06-048-05.png,Where are your souls ? ' Lily-yo and Flor looked at
m06-048-06.png,each other . In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
m06-048-07.png,heedlessly thrown down their souls .
m06-056-00.png,Haris had trampled on his . It was unthinkable !
m06-056-01.png,' You see . You needed them no more . You are still
m06-056-02.png,young . You may be able to have babies . Some of those
m06-056-03.png,babies may be born with wings . ' The Captive with
m06-056-04.png,"the boneless arms added , ' Some may be born wrong ,"
m06-056-05.png,as we are . Some may be born right . '
m06-067-00.png,' You are too foul to live ! ' Haris growled . ' Why are
m06-067-01.png,"you not killed ? ' ' Because we know all things , ' the"
m06-067-02.png,Chief Captive said . Suddenly his second head roused
m06-067-03.png,"itself and declared , ' To be a good shape is not all"
m06-067-04.png,in life . To know is also good . Because we cannot move
m06-067-05.png,well we can - think . This tribe of the True World
m06-067-06.png,is good and knows these things .
m06-076-00.png,So it lets us rule it . ' Flor and Lily-yo
m06-076-01.png,muttered together . ' Do you say that you poor
m06-076-02.png,Captives rule the True World ? ' Lily-yo asked
m06-076-03.png,at last . ' We do . ' ' Then why are you captives ? '
m06-076-04.png,"The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected ,"
m06-076-05.png,"making his perpetual little gesture of protest ,"
m06-076-06.png,spoke for the first time .
m06-083-00.png,"' To rule is to serve , woman . Those who bear power"
m06-083-01.png,are slaves to it . Only an outcast is free . Because
m06-083-02.png,"we are Captives , we have the time to talk and"
m06-083-03.png,think and plan and know . Those who know
m06-083-04.png,command the knives of others . ' ' No hurt will
m06-083-05.png,"come to you , Lily-yo , ' Band Appa Bondi added ."
m06-083-06.png,' You will live among us and enjoy your life free
m06-083-07.png,from harm . '
m06-091-00.png,' No ! ' the Chief Captive said with both mouths .
m06-091-01.png,"' Before she can enjoy , Lily-yo and her companion"
m06-091-02.png,Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
m06-091-03.png,must help our great plan . ' ' The invasion ? ' Bondi
m06-091-04.png,"asked . ' What else ? Flor and Lily-yo , you arrive"
m06-091-05.png,here at a good time . Memories of the Heavy World
m06-091-06.png,and its savage life are still fresh in you .
m06-098-00.png,We need such memories . So we ask you to go
m06-098-01.png,back there on a great plan we have . ' ' Go back ? '
m06-098-02.png,gasped Flor . ' Yes . We plan to attack the Heavy
m06-098-03.png,World . You must help to lead our force . ' The long
m06-098-04.png,"afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road"
m06-098-05.png,of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
m06-098-06.png,everlasting night .
m06-106-00.png,"Motion there was , but motion without event - except"
m06-106-01.png,for those negligible events that seemed so large to
m06-106-02.png,"the creatures participating in them . For Lily-yo , Flor"
m06-106-03.png,and Haris there were many events . Chief of these was
m06-106-04.png,that they learned to fly properly . The pains associated
m06-106-05.png,with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
m06-106-06.png,new flesh and tendon strengthened . To sail up in the
m06-106-07.png,light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
m06-106-08.png,flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
m06-106-09.png,had no place here .
n01-000-00.png,Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had
n01-000-01.png,been inclined to regard women as something
n01-000-02.png,which must necessarily be subordinated to his
n01-000-03.png,career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
n01-000-04.png,"his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl"
n01-000-05.png,whom he had never met and on whom after no more
n01-000-06.png,than a couple of telephone calls he was
n01-000-07.png,prepared to place complete reliance .
n01-004-00.png,It was a novel experience . Alastair was
n01-004-01.png,quite unable to explain why he should feel
n01-004-02.png,so much confidence in her . Once again
n01-004-03.png,she checked back her instructions . It was
n01-004-04.png,obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
n01-004-05.png,faith which he was placing in her and
n01-004-06.png,was prepared to accept the responsibility .
n01-009-00.png,""" Good luck , Air Marshal , "" she said gently . "" I 'll"
n01-009-01.png,be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
n01-009-02.png,evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
n01-009-03.png,"both at midnight . "" They might have been"
n01-009-04.png,arranging a supper party . Then she rang off .
n01-009-05.png,Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
n01-009-06.png,uneventful life had he come across a girl who
n01-009-07.png,sounded so charming and appeared to be so
n01-009-08.png,efficient .
n01-020-00.png,For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
n01-020-01.png,to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
n01-020-02.png,physical features were distinguishable solely by
n01-020-03.png,gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow-
n01-020-04.png,"capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles"
n01-020-05.png,"below , was not recognisable among the host"
n01-020-06.png,of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air
n01-020-07.png,radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots
n01-020-08.png,"flickered across its surface , but there was"
n01-020-09.png,no permanent image .
n01-031-00.png,In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
n01-031-01.png,make a direct comparison between the radar
n01-031-02.png,image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the
n01-031-03.png,"Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the"
n01-031-04.png,"left , Milan . The directional angle of the"
n01-031-05.png,scanner could be adjusted to cover any
n01-031-06.png,particular area within its range . Geoffrey
n01-031-07.png,turned the scale slowly to cover the
n01-031-08.png,ground immediately ahead .
n01-036-00.png,"He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the"
n01-036-01.png,"naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even"
n01-036-02.png,on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced
n01-036-03.png,at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that
n01-036-04.png,the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
n01-036-05.png,was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
n01-045-00.png,"Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the"
n01-045-01.png,pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
n01-045-02.png,dipped slightly . The needle of the speed
n01-045-03.png,"recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0"
n01-045-04.png,"before coming to rest at 5.0 . "" We 're a bit"
n01-045-05.png,"ahead of time , "" said Alastair . "" We 'll run"
n01-045-06.png,"in on minimum engine power . "" Geoffrey"
n01-045-07.png,smiled . Alastair talked of running in when
n01-045-08.png,they were still more than four hundred
n01-045-09.png,miles from their destination .
n01-052-00.png,They were nearing Modena . Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
n01-052-01.png,"on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port ."
n01-052-02.png,He was able to trace the course of the river ; he
n01-052-03.png,"thought he could recognise the route of N12 ,"
n01-052-04.png,along which he had motored so desperately little
n01-052-05.png,more than twenty-four hours earlier . Since then
n01-052-06.png,"he had flown to England , attended the vital"
n01-052-07.png,"conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked"
n01-052-08.png,by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
n01-052-09.png,"Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed"
n01-052-10.png,refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
n01-052-11.png,of the journey back to the place where every
n01-052-12.png,indication pointed to Eve being held .
n01-057-00.png,Geoffrey set himself to consider the
n01-057-01.png,movements of the Bentley . It had passed
n01-057-02.png,him at the temporary bridge over the
n01-057-03.png,Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
n01-057-04.png,previous night . He worked out the distance
n01-057-05.png,on the presumption that its route had been
n01-057-06.png,through Florence and Rome and then
n01-057-07.png,across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
n01-057-08.png,It came to just over six hundred
n01-057-09.png,miles .
n02-000-00.png,DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
n02-000-01.png,"time they docked at Belleray . And though Guy ,"
n02-000-02.png,"made nervous by Beryl's silence , drove at reckless"
n02-000-03.png,"speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that"
n02-000-04.png,the party was over . Piers came strolling out to
n02-000-05.png,"meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had"
n02-000-06.png,"driven away , invited them casually to come to"
n02-000-07.png,his flat for a drink .
n02-004-00.png,"To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a"
n02-004-01.png,vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
n02-004-02.png,reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
n02-004-03.png,But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
n02-004-04.png,was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
n02-004-05.png,"He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his"
n02-004-06.png,"own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of"
n02-004-07.png,asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
n02-004-08.png,to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
n02-009-00.png,""" I caught him just as he was going to the"
n02-009-01.png,"airport to meet Blanche , "" he said . "" As a matter"
n02-009-02.png,of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise
n02-009-03.png,for me and fetch her . He brought her to the party
n02-009-04.png,"too . They 're both here . "" "" I didn't know she was"
n02-009-05.png,"coming back from Barbados so soon . "" Beryl"
n02-009-06.png,said the first thing that came into her head .
n02-016-00.png,""" Oh , she was due ! "" And then he added in the same"
n02-016-01.png,"casual tone , "" She 's not returning to her family . She 's"
n02-016-02.png,"going to live with friends of the bank manager , just"
n02-016-03.png,"this side of Belleray . "" Mrs. Deane made a suitable"
n02-016-04.png,"comment , but Beryl said nothing . She was trying"
n02-016-05.png,to sort things out in her mind . That beneath his
n02-016-06.png,unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering
n02-016-07.png,with anger against her she had no doubt .
n02-028-00.png,"Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to"
n02-028-01.png,express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
n02-028-02.png,"of his guests . But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl"
n02-028-03.png,"suggested having a second party , the following week , he"
n02-028-04.png,"poured cold water on the project . Everyone , he declared ,"
n02-028-05.png,"had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them"
n02-028-06.png,nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile
n02-028-07.png,Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
n02-028-08.png,earned gratuity to his native village at the
n02-028-09.png,north of the island .
n02-033-00.png,It was all over and done with .
n02-033-01.png,For the time being Beryl was content to let
n02-033-02.png,"it go at that , but she resolved to have"
n02-033-03.png,it out with Piers when a reasonable
n02-033-04.png,opportunity presented itself . He must
n02-033-05.png,learn that he could not treat her
n02-033-06.png,"with injustice and contempt , ignoring"
n02-033-07.png,her explanations as though he were
n02-033-08.png,"a schoolmaster and she a small ,"
n02-033-09.png,ignorant child .
n02-037-00.png,He gave her no chance of any private
n02-037-01.png,"conversation that evening , for when"
n02-037-02.png,"Blanche and Jack left , he went with"
n02-037-03.png,them . But next morning she insisted
n02-037-04.png,on his taking her out in the jeep -
n02-037-05.png,"to find , if possible , Hubert and his"
n02-037-06.png,"relations , and tell them of"
n02-037-07.png,her great disappointment at being
n02-037-08.png,held up in Balicou .
n02-040-00.png,"With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his"
n02-040-01.png,"Boxer , to the back , and made room for her"
n02-040-02.png,"beside him . "" Is that all you want to do ? """
n02-040-03.png,"he asked , letting in the clutch . "" No ; I want"
n02-040-04.png,to make you understand just what happened
n02-040-05.png,"about this Balicou trip , "" she returned"
n02-040-06.png,"coldly . "" I 'm a little tired of being treated"
n02-040-07.png,"like an ineffective imbecile . """
n02-045-00.png,""" And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called"
n02-045-01.png,"to account for my manners , "" he retorted ."

n02-049-03.png,"look as though it was only what you expected of me ,"

n02-049-05.png,"and his pals down . """

n02-054-04.png,""" Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers !"
n02-054-05.png,"Be yourself , "" she exclaimed , with"
n02-054-06.png,"mounting exasperation . "" Very well ! "" He"
n02-054-07.png,brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
n02-054-08.png,path fringed and shaded by citrus trees .
n02-054-09.png,""" If you want my true opinion I 'll give it ."
n02-062-00.png,You made some sort of a protest to Graybury .

n02-082a-04.png,"The mockery in his voice had deepened . "" With"

n02-082a-06.png,She met his eyes then .
n02-098-00.png,"She wavered , and at last said"
n02-098-01.png,"slowly , "" If you must drag the truth"

r02-000-06.png,life-insurances or any of the other normal

r02-003-00.png,He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the
r02-003-01.png,provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her
r02-003-02.png,"to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases , but also"
r02-003-03.png,postponed demanding the tax until her financial year
r02-003-04.png,"was ended , audited and agreed by the Inspector . The"
r02-003-05.png,"process could , and often did take several years ."
r02-006-00.png,At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake

r02-006-04.png,"ther her career . Alternatively , it"
r02-006-05.png,"was reported , she tearfully claimed"
r02-006-06.png,that the warm coats were heating
r02-006-07.png,appliances and therefore susceptible
r02-006-08.png,to a depreciation tax allowance
r02-006-09.png,as plant and machinery . The
r02-010-00.png,"Between all the interested parties , the final"
r02-010-01.png,agreement had been delayed long enough for
r02-010-02.png,Miss Cheesecake to spend all the money which
r02-010-03.png,by rights should have been reserved for her tax .
r02-010-04.png,"Discounting one chinchilla jacket , a Rolls-"

r02-013-00.png,The train drew into another station
r02-013-01.png,"and Cecil , with a further six stops"
r02-013-02.png,"to go , was left almost alone in the"

r02-013-04.png,lected the long correspondence he
r02-013-05.png,had had with the Inland Reve-
r02-013-06.png,nue in an effort to obtain
r02-013-07.png,tax relief for a jacket used
r02-013-08.png,solely in the office . ' If the jacket
r02-013-09.png,"is a condition of your employment , '"
r02-013-10.png,"the Inspector had written , ' it may"
r02-013-11.png,qualify for relief . '

r02-038-03.png,the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil .
r02-038-04.png,He wondered what it contained . Probably the remains
r02-038-05.png,of someone's lunch or a few secret files .
r02-038-06.png,He smiled at his own joke .
r02-054-00.png,It was locked . Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
r02-054-01.png,when he shook the case there was a rustling thud
r02-054-02.png,"of wads of paper . ' Cor ! ' he muttered aloud , ' there 's"
r02-054-03.png,five thousand at least . ' He felt in his jacket pocket

r02-060-00.png,Cecil searched in his pockets once
r02-060-01.png,more and came up with two
r02-060-02.png,paper-clips . After a few seconds
r02-060-03.png,"of twisting , he roughly thrust a"
r02-060-04.png,bent wire loop into the lock and
r02-060-05.png,waggled it around vigorously .
r02-060-06.png,There was a click and the
r02-060-07.png,briefcase opened . Cecil thrust an

r02-060-10.png,pound notes .
r02-065-00.png,"They closed on a single bundle and , fumbling with"
r02-065-01.png,"nervous excitement , he pulled it out . His eye"
r02-065-02.png,rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one
r02-065-03.png,"side . ' Old fashioned fivers ! ' he muttered again , and"
r02-065-04.png,tried to recall if they were still legal tender . Surely the
r02-065-05.png,Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never

r06-003-03.png,is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar . For one
r06-003-04.png,"day , with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative , we had been"

r06-007-01.png,"a good address . ' Now , after a woman's radar look ,"
r06-007-02.png,she decided Pierre would solve our problems . This
r06-007-03.png,"was true , Pierre was a true Provenc*?6al , thin and"
r06-007-04.png,"yellow as lemon peel , wrestling with some gnawing rat"
r06-007-05.png,"of an illness , man of all trades , married to a commanding"
r06-007-06.png,lady who loved small talk and the discreet

r06-011-05.png,We were shown around by Pierre .
r06-018-00.png,The flat was on the third floor ; two rooms ; soft Provenc*?

r06-018-02.png,"hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up ,"
r06-018-03.png,"basin and bidet ; own private , modern lavatory . The"
r06-018-04.png,first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence .
r06-018-05.png,We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
r06-018-06.png,eruption of turtle-doves .
r06-022-00.png,"This was strange , even magic , because the owner's"
r06-022-01.png,"name was Pierre Tortorolo which , in Nicoison Italian means"
r06-022-02.png,' turtledove ' . Pierre Turtledove . When we woke up properly it
r06-022-03.png,"was raining , an even more hopeless rain than London , and we"
r06-022-04.png,looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
r06-022-05.png,curling white breath of the mountains . The land looked
r06-022-06.png,like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
r06-022-07.png,shame .
r06-027-00.png,"There they were , in fact , below us , eight of them ."
r06-027-01.png,"Four of them were flattened on the window sills , two"
r06-027-02.png,"immolated on a nearby roof top , the other pair copulating ."
r06-027-03.png,We had a morning at Pierre's . He talked about people .
r06-027-04.png,Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
r06-027-05.png,"Lawrence . He was here , near the railway station , three or"
r06-027-06.png,"four years . During this period he wrote a book ,"
r06-027-07.png,The Lover of Lady Chatterly .
r06-035-00.png,"No , he hadn't read it ; Madame did all the"
r06-035-01.png,reading . Lawrence died in this very place .
r06-035-02.png,He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
r06-035-03.png,"again . No , he couldn't really remember"
r06-035-04.png,"him , he was one of the crowd . The"
r06-035-05.png,sun came out ; Mart went shopping ; I
r06-035-06.png,sat in the square reading the Patriote .
r06-041-00.png,There was a front-page rear-attack on de
r06-041-01.png,"Gaulle , and the rest of the paper was given up"
r06-041-02.png,"to murders , apart for an outcry against a"
r06-041-03.png,proposal to drop radio-active material into
r06-041-04.png,the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
r06-041-05.png,Raphael . All the murders were well documented
r06-041-06.png,and had the air of being written by an
r06-041-07.png,"ingenious , but mad film director of the"
r06-041-08.png,Thirties .
r06-044-00.png,They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses .
r06-044-01.png,"Monsieur H , for instance , had been clubbed and"
r06-044-02.png,"throttled to death by his wife , children and"
r06-044-03.png,"father-in-law , after muddling up some sheep"
r06-044-04.png,while the worse for drink . The family
r06-044-05.png,group then sat down for a late lunch
r06-044-06.png,before the father-in-law telephoned the police .
r06-044-07.png,"Then again , Monsieur V , owing to family"
r06-044-08.png,"troubles , had written to the local"
r06-044-09.png,"paper and the superintendent of police ,"
r06-044-10.png,informing them that he was on the point
r06-049-00.png,Monsieur V's house was immediately
r06-049-01.png,"surrounded by firemen and other officials ,"
r06-049-02.png,but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned
r06-049-03.png,"a few minutes later from a nearby village ,"
r06-049-04.png,"apologising for the trouble , but explaining"
r06-049-05.png,that the walls were porous and the
r06-049-06.png,gas had escaped . General relief was
r06-049-07.png,"expressed , but Monsieur V ( this was"
r06-049-08.png,actually reported in the next issue ) returned
r06-049-09.png,"home and shot himself , leaving a note"
r06-049-10.png,which again left his household goods
r06-053-00.png,Some grim comic relief was provided by
r06-053-01.png,an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
r06-053-02.png,who hid himself in a bush and imitated
r06-053-03.png,a blackbird . Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
r06-053-04.png,was after this very bird and shot the farm-
r06-053-05.png,"labourer in the face . All , however ,"
r06-053-06.png,"ended well , reported the paper , since the"
r06-053-07.png,pellets were easily removed and the
r06-053-08.png,labourer was able to return to work the
r06-053-09.png,same afternoon .
r06-057-00.png,We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta .
r06-057-01.png,You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
r06-057-02.png,way . In the middle of the journey is a
r06-057-03.png,valley with a sea of vines and olives
r06-057-04.png,and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
r06-057-05.png,the hoe . Rising from the flecked sea are
r06-057-06.png,islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
r06-057-07.png,"towns , grey , rose-headed mariners clinging"
r06-057-08.png,like limpets to the rock .
r06-062-00.png,There is a curd of morning smoke and
r06-062-01.png,a muffled bell taps the sky . Here we
r06-062-02.png,"stopped , as in fine weather we always"
r06-062-03.png,stopped . Down below is the village of
r06-062-04.png,"Cagnes , but between are pockets of"
r06-062-05.png,heat and cold like the hands of
r06-062-06.png,"friends or strangers , and a flurry of"
r06-062-07.png,"early smells , the dark bosoms of"
r06-062-08.png,beech and the thin pine fingers
r06-062-09.png,kissed by the sun .
r06-066-00.png,"Then here was Nice , and the old holiday"
r06-066-01.png,"sea , blue as a new school exercise"
r06-066-02.png,"book . The same old Nice , creamy ,"
r06-066-03.png,"vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with"
r06-066-04.png,the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
r06-066-05.png,"prostitutes , edging past grubby grandeur"
r06-066-06.png,"to the old sleeping port . This , and"
r06-066-07.png,"Paris , were my ruined pavilions , and I"
r06-066-08.png,could catch the taste of dead dreams on
r06-066-09.png,my tongue like spray .
r06-070-00.png,We parked the Lambretta opposite the
r06-070-01.png,"Negresco , and went to the beach to"
r06-070-02.png,have a swim . Amazing bedlam rocked
r06-070-03.png,"in our eyes . The sea boiled with waves ,"
r06-070-04.png,they galloped to the walls and spumed
r06-070-05.png,over the Promenade des Anglais . A huge
r06-070-06.png,crowd had collected . There were firemen
r06-070-07.png,"and policemen and ambulances , and the"
r06-070-08.png,eyes of the spectators were hard with
r06-070-09.png,disaster .
r06-076-00.png,They all had that neat look of
r06-076-01.png,Mediterranean people to whom nothing
r06-076-02.png,"could ever happen , the chosen sane , the"
r06-076-03.png,"uncuckolded , unrobbed , sheltered from"
r06-076-04.png,"disease and accident by doctors , God and"
r06-076-05.png,"the municipality . Yet , at any time now ,"
r06-076-06.png,the bell would ring for them - the gilded
r06-076-07.png,"love house , the mad grandmother or the"
r06-076-08.png,bloody child at the crossroads .
r06-090-00.png,It was growing cold . We left the
r06-090-01.png,crowd and drove back to Vence .
r06-090-02.png,The cool evening perfumes stood
r06-090-03.png,beckoning at the corners of the roads .
r06-090-04.png,Mart is unable to smell ( her sense
r06-090-05.png,"organs were impaired years ago ) , and"
r06-090-06.png,"I had to explain the low , sharp and"
r06-090-07.png,sweet signals in the air . When we
r06-090-08.png,got back home we felt exhausted .
r06-090-09.png,"London sickness ( a sense of guilt ,"
r06-090-10.png,mingled with the memory of sandwiches
r06-097-00.png,We went straight to bed and slept until
r06-097-01.png,the turtle-doves drummed up the
r06-097-02.png,"sun . The next morning , in the square"
r06-097-03.png,"opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice"
r06-097-04.png,beach catastrophe in the Patriote .
r06-097-05.png,"Mart had been right , the body had been"
r06-097-06.png,a woman's . It belonged to a Madame
r06-097-07.png,N. Enquiries had been made in the
r06-097-08.png,"neighbourhood , and it transpired that"
r06-097-09.png,Madame N's husband had made an
r06-097-10.png,arrangement with the dead lady's sister
r06-103-00.png,"The sister , able to swim , had returned"
r06-103-01.png,"to the shore , but instead of returning"
r06-103-02.png,to her brother-in-law ( with whom
r06-103-03.png,"she had an illicit relationship ) , she"
r06-103-04.png,went to her fiance*?2's house and
r06-103-05.png,confessed everything . Her fiance*?2
r06-103-06.png,"reported her to the police , and then jumped"
r06-103-07.png,off a cliff near Monte Carlo .
r06-106-00.png,The day I promised to take Catherine
r06-106-01.png,down to visit my young friend Philip
r06-106-02.png,"at his school in the country , we were"
r06-106-03.png,"to leave at eleven , but she arrived"
r06-106-04.png,"at nine . Her blue dress was new ,"
r06-106-05.png,and so were her fashionable shoes . Her
r06-106-06.png,hair had just been done . She looked
r06-106-07.png,more than ever like a pink and gold
r06-106-08.png,Renoir girl who expects everything from
r06-106-09.png,life .
r06-111-00.png,Catherine lives in a white house
r06-111-01.png,overlooking the sweeping brown tides
r06-111-02.png,of the river . She helped me clean up my
r06-111-03.png,flat with a devotion which said that
r06-111-04.png,she felt small flats were altogether more
r06-111-05.png,romantic than large houses . We drank
r06-111-06.png,"tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who ,"
r06-111-07.png,"being 15 , has pure stern tastes in every-"
r06-111-08.png,thing from food to music .
r06-115-00.png,Catherine looked at the books lying
r06-115-01.png,"around his room , and asked if she"
r06-115-02.png,might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
r06-115-03.png,to read on the train . Catherine is 13 .
r06-115-04.png,I suggested she might find them dif-
r06-115-05.png,"ficult , but she said , ' Philip reads them ,"
r06-115-06.png,doesn't he ? ' During the journey I read
r06-115-07.png,newspapers and watched her pretty
r06-115-08.png,frowning face as she turned the
r06-115-09.png,"pages of Babel , for she was determined"
r06-115-10.png,to let nothing get between her and
r06-121-00.png,"At the school , which is charming , ci-"
r06-121-01.png,"vilised and expensive , the two children"
r06-121-02.png,"walked together across green fields , and"
r06-121-03.png,"I followed , seeing how the sun gilded"
r06-121-04.png,their bright friendly heads turned
r06-121-05.png,towards each other as they talked . In
r06-121-06.png,Catherine's left hand she carried the
r06-121-07.png,stories of Isaac Babel . After lunch we
r06-121-08.png,went to the pictures . Philip allowed
r06-121-09.png,# it to be seen that he thought going to
r06-121-10.png,the pictures just for the fun of it was
r06-126-00.png,For his sake we chose the more
r06-126-01.png,serious of the two films that were
r06-126-02.png,showing in the little town . It was
r06-126-03.png,about a good priest who helped cri-
r06-126-04.png,"minals in New York . His goodness , how-"
r06-126-05.png,"ever , was not enough to prevent one"
r06-126-06.png,of them from being sent to the gas
r06-126-07.png,chamber ; and Philip and I waited with
r06-126-08.png,Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
r06-126-09.png,crying and could face the light of a golden
r06-126-10.png,evening .
r06-130-00.png,At the entrance of the cinema the
r06-130-01.png,doorman was lying in wait for anyone
r06-130-02.png,who had red eyes . Grasping Catherine
r06-130-03.png,"by her suffering arm , he said bitterly :"
r06-130-04.png,"' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be"
r06-130-05.png,"punished for his crime , didn't he ? ' Cathe-"
r06-130-06.png,"rine stared at him , incredulous . Philip"
r06-130-07.png,rescued her by saying with disdain :
r06-130-08.png,' Some people don't know right from wrong
r06-130-09.png,even when its demonstrated to them . '
r06-137-00.png,The doorman turned his attention
r06-137-01.png,to the next red-eyed emerger from the
r06-137-02.png,dark ; and we went on together to
r06-137-03.png,"the station , the children silent because"
r06-137-04.png,of the cruelty of the world . Finally Catherine
r06-137-05.png,"said , her eyes wet again : ' I think its all"
r06-137-06.png,"absolutely beastly , and I can't bear to think"

301-11.png,losses by delaying the Commissaries at Williamsburgh:
301-12.png,"many of the Carolina Beeves are dead, through abmi"
301-13.png,solute povertysq and the chief part of them too poor
301-14.png,"to slaughter. We are at a loss how to act, for want"
301-15.png,of the mutiny Billsq and should be obliged to
301-16.png,"your Honour to have fifty or an hundred printed,"
301-17.png,and sent by the Bearer. There is a clause in
301-18.png,"that Bill, which if you are not kind enough"

302-03.png,"Kettles: those sent from below being Tin, are of"

302-05.png,suffer as much for want of Clothingsq none

302-08.png,we are disappointed off. Shoes and Stockings
302-09.png,"we have, and can get more if wanted, but"
302-10.png,nothing else. I should be glad your Honor
302-11.png,would direct what is to be done in these cami
302-12.png,sessq and that you would be kind enough to
302-13.png,desire the Treasurer to send some part of the
302-14.png,"money in gold and silver: were this done, we"
302-15.png,might often get necessaries for the Regiment

302-18.png,it is is impossiblesq our paper not passing there.
302-19.png,The recruiting Service goes on exmi
302-20.png,tremely slow. Yesterday being a day appointed
302-21.png,"for Rendezvousing at this place, there came in"

302-23.png,"any other than paper money, and you appromi"

302-25.png,"and the Borders of Carolina: I am confident,"
