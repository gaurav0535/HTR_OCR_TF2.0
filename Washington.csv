302-08.png,we are disappointed off. Shoes and Stockings
302-09.png,"we have, and can get more if wanted, but"
302-10.png,nothing else. I should be glad your Honor
302-11.png,would direct what is to be done in these cami
302-12.png,sessq and that you would be kind enough to
302-13.png,desire the Treasurer to send some part of the

302-15.png,might often get necessaries for the Regiment

302-19.png,The recruiting Service goes on exmi
302-20.png,tremely slow. Yesterday being a day appointed
302-21.png,"for Rendezvousing at this place, there came in"
